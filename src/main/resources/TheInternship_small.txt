these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D 

I came to see the trailer because DYLAN! <33 :DD

When girls say they like guys with glasses, they mean Dylan O'brien

Dylan/Stuart ????????

This is the best movie !! Watch it 

Dylannnnnnnnnnnn <3

This movie was already awesome as heck, and Dylan made it more interesting. LOVED THIS MOVIE!

only for DYLAN!!!!

dylan o'brien is the absolute love of my life omfg

came for the dylan, stayed for the... well dylan

Dylan O'Brien's the bae

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

God, this movie sucked!!

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D 

I came to see the trailer because DYLAN! <33 :DD

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch.

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D 

I came to see the trailer because DYLAN! <33 :DD

When girls say they like guys with glasses, they mean Dylan O'brien

Dylan/Stuart ????????

Dylan O'Brien's the bae

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D 

I came to see the trailer because DYLAN! <33 :DD

When girls say they like guys with glasses, they mean Dylan O'brien

Dylan/Stuart ????????

This is the best movie !! Watch it 

Dylannnnnnnnnnnn <3

This movie was already awesome as heck, and Dylan made it more interesting. LOVED THIS MOVIE!

only for DYLAN!!!!

dylan o'brien is the absolute love of my life omfg

came for the dylan, stayed for the... well dylan

Dylan O'Brien's the bae

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

???? ??? ??? - ?????!??, ??? ??? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ??????? ????? ????? ??????? ???? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????, ? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ? ?????????? ????? ?????? ????? - ??? ???? ??? ???????? ? ??????? ?? ?????............??????? ??? ?? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ????? ???? ??????? ??????? ????? ?????? , ? ?? ?????? ? ???? ????????? - ??? ???????? ???????? - ????? ????, ??? ?? ??? ?? ????????, ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????????

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch.

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid.

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and its an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, ready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?


And I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists are....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!

Maybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.

/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.

I'm only watching for Dylan O'brien...

One of my favorite movies ever.

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien. 

Nonstop funny. Clever take on a theme 

This was me when I first watched this trailer. 
*watches first 20 seconds of trailer*
"Hmm this seems like a pretty entertaining movie. I'll wait to watch it when it's available to download on the internet."
*continues watching trailer*
"Wait. Is that Dylan O'brien?!"
*continues watching*
"Holy crap it is! This looks like the best movie ever!"
*quickly orders tickets for the midnight showing premiere in my area*

Excellent movie with a great message!

These two were better in "The Wedding Crashers" 

omggg dylan plays in it :D i'm so gonna watch it :)

youtube can suck a dick trying to sell movies on here for 12.99

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

The internship was a great movie all those who say working at google is lame or stupid and its for idiots. Those people are haters, those fucking people make shit loads of money nd they have fun

Am I the only one that watched this movie really late at night because of Dylan O'Brien?

Can anybody tell me the name of that song its driving me crazy

well that was BAD. Basically a big commercial for Google ! Would have been ok if it was at least funny. 2 hours of my time I'm never getting back, what a shame.

Dylan o'brien would be the only reason to watch this movie 

Professor Xavier, hahha I lost it at the point ??

STILES?! is that you?!!

Not even close to as good as wedding crashers.

This film is a 90 minute advertisement for Google. 
Vince you have sold your soul!! 
And it was a particularly shit film...  

I liked to see Sergey Brin there,

It was aight. Wedding crashers was way better tho

Wait wait wait wait wait hold up google? Well that's funny.... (Cuz were on Google+!)

this movie shows how easy it is to get an internship in google!

Ugggh unbearable to watch. Shut it off in 15 min

these guys sure know how to be annoying

God, this movie sucked!!

This movie wanted me to get a job at google.

I am going to Barthalonaa

sequal?

I am guy and you know why i'm here, no homo tho.

Since i watched this movie, i got the Googliness attitude !!

Omfg Dylan Is Too Cute <3

Yeah, nobody here can deny that they haven't watched a movie or tv show just because an actor is in it. So y'all can calm down, and enjoy the movie.

DYLANNNNNNNN



"OMG STILES"
"OMG DYLAN"
yah you like him. We get it.
Shut the fuck up.

If anyone is interested in actually working at Google, a Googler is hosting a live session this week including a 1 hour presentation, 20 minute Q/A, and a PDF of prep questions. $40 if interested, message me for more details!

I loved this movie, don't understand all the hate.

I will not be having a beerrr with you.

The only reason I'm watching this is to see Dylan in glasses. . .

Creepy nose warning! Yes someone has cast that guy in a film again.

Omg, Dylan O'Brien is perfection

Just bought the movie for 5$ can't wait to watch it.

Watched this while ago! :D 
Exelent movie! ;D

I don't know who Dylan is, Why is everyone here obsessed with him? Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson means nothing to you guys? WTF! 

Cho mình h?i tìm internship full movie ?ddaau v?y. Cái mà không c?n click Link ?ó.

so many bots spamming here wtf?

The only reason I watched this is because of Dylan O'brien.

IM ONLY HERE FOR DYLAN 

Good movie

Who the fuck is this Dylan person ?

liles and stiles :)

I totally agree with Void Rina, this movie was fucking hilarious, even without Dylan!  I mean I love him to death, but I swear all you fan girls are going to storm every movie and only watch it because dyLAN FUCKING O'BRIEN

I just finished watching it, and in the end credit scene, there's a link that leads here. gah.

I watch Only Dylan O'brien?
He is my lifesaver/

The best movie i have ever seen in my life. I recomend it. If you`re not watching it, you dont know what you are missing :D

I'm gonna watch the movie ... I heard Dylan is in this movie.

DYLAN

Dylan! !! Love this movie

?

That's a sharpie btw genius? Dylan?

the wedding crashers are back

This movie is great!
Don't really care who's in it but a movie definitely worth watching. 

Dylan O'Brien :)?!

Dylan O'Brien ?? The only reason  I'm going to watch this movie <333

Dylan O'Brien!!!!

This movie is a google commercial.

Exactly 

great movie! really entertaining :)

0:09 his voice like peter griffin :D 

I came to see the trailer because DYLAN! <33 :DD

When girls say they like guys with glasses, they mean Dylan O'brien

Dylan/Stuart ????????

This is the best movie !! Watch it 

Dylannnnnnnnnnnn <3

This movie was already awesome as heck, and Dylan made it more interesting. LOVED THIS MOVIE!

only for DYLAN!!!!

dylan o'brien is the absolute love of my life omfg

came for the dylan, stayed for the... well dylan

Dylan O'Brien's the bae

Dylan O'Brian is so hot! ??

Dylan <3

???? ??? ??? - ?????!??, ??? ??? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ??????? ????? ????? ??????? ???? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????, ? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ? ?????????? ????? ?????? ????? - ??? ???? ??? ???????? ? ??????? ?? ?????............??????? ??? ?? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ????? ???? ??????? ??????? ????? ?????? , ? ?? ?????? ? ???? ????????? - ??? ???????? ???????? - ????? ????, ??? ?? ??? ?? ????????, ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????????

DYLAN

Despite all the negativity comments in here I personally think this movie was freaking awesome and inspiring!!!  Anything is possible. Believe!!!

It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what I read is bout Dylan XD

Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended up in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things like hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no body really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of course)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing 

Uugh.. Dylan o'brien in The Internship, a boyband, The Maze Runner and Teen Wolf!! THIS IS PERFECTION ????

Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he didn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.

?????????????

i watched this film on the plane and i loved it... i didn't realise that Dylan O'Brien was in it cos i wasn't familiar with him at the time, but now I'm in love!

I think i will see this movie only because of Dylan O'Brien ??

This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to young people!

omg i love this movie! it was hilarious

DYLANNNN

Im watching this for Dylan O'brien xxx

DYLAN ?

I just watched a movie all about Google, I googled to find to see how people think of it, and now I'm commenting on Google. Interesting.!

isnt that the dude from night at the museum? 

take me down to the paradise city.....

SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand needs it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some stereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?
Full of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds how to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother and the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and rascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.
Its trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is important as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just ends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable personalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become more mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN MATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem with it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a virgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal with it.

And the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an overt ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the dream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.
I´ve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe the worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is one of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they gonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic alterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the same tech of course ;).

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3

watching this right now ?? its gonna be so funny.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch.

What a waste of 2 hours with this boring,tedious,unfunny ''comedy''. It's lame, predictable,  badly written, generic movie which felt like 4 hours with not a single LAUGH OUT LOUD moment. Just like hangover 3 it's comedy for retards.

yifi

I just watched this, pretty nice movie!
Funny, a bit of inspiring, interesting... And these 2 actors are amazing together!

Am I the only one that thinks that   exchange-a-gram  sounds like a drug selling site ???

haha saw the movie just for dylan o'brien and turned out to be a pretty good movie

Good movie to watch. Funny, Inspirational and up with the times.

There's a part of the trailer which isn't in the movie... staring from 1:01

real nice actually... I love it when they team up, so funny :P

the trailer made this movie looks terrible. I'm going to watch something else 

lol PROFESSER X IS A TOTAL DICK! so funnneh

cool

Only here for Dylan O'Brian

mmm...Dylan Obryen

i came for leia...............using the after credits link lol. instead i got this trailer :(

I watch it on the plane!! Great movie!!! Very inspiring!!

What's this song under video? please write the song name!!! Thank you;)

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson must have designed the new comment system.

Freediver CWT: You couldn't say it better. That's what I think, everyday when I use google. Matter of fact, it wouldn't be such a big problem to deactivate all this accounts and never look back. 
Matter of fact 2: all Microsoft, Yahoo, and so on, are same bullsheet and this world is more and more crazy and intrusive, day by day. 

Nothing you can do, but we all should go in the mountains :)

couldn't say it any better bro.

Google commercial. Fake!!

Lol I only came here for Dylan O' Bryan

It's Paradise City by Guns N' Roses

Fake. None of those codes worked out.

ACDC

Hi guys, 

anyone know the song for the last instrumental music for this movie's credits?

Looks interesting but not funny

lol

hey google +, go fuck yourself 
oh and no need to reply to this as I most likely won't even be aware that you did in the first place you cocksuckers, I want my inbox back to where it was already a bitch to find it

1:52 You are HIV Aladeen.....

To be honest... I found this movie a bit too embarrassing to watch. 

The only reason I watched this movie was because of Dylan O'Brien, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hilarious and very inspiring?

 does anyone realizes that what this sense at 0:23-0:33 that  its like watching Sulley and Lightning McQueen onscreen

This whole movie was a Google advert.

I'm just now hearing about this movie, and it has Dylan O'Brien... Seriously?

On the line

I enjoyed this movie. Another good comedy from Owen and Vince. 

My sweet Dylan 

Loved this movie because of Dylan O'Brien <333

Abe? 

With people complaining and sht, I would much rather work at google than a dead end job.

Great fun movie to watch. 

Dylan 3333

This movie is just delightful! I loved every single bit of it. Its a must watch and I hope you wont make the mistake of not doing that. 

Brother, will you ice my balls.......Brother!!

Hipster paradise.

This was unoriginal and boring sorry :(

This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that bad).

i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds great

Anyone else feel like this and Monsters University were the same movie?

Great movie!

Dylan ?????

Dylan O Brien YAHH

At 0:13 it is Thrift Shop

And thats how GOOGLE + was born.

im not very good at communicing with other human beings

If Dylan really worked in google I would work there just to see him ahaha

DYLAN AHHH IM ONLY HERE FOR HIM

Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, retarded games, wtf??

Dylan<3

Watched it four times cause DYLAN O BRIEN <12346789123478912347892345678

follow @DawgKiba on twitter, also great movie

Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0

hi there stiles *-*

Went for the Dylan O'Brien, and stayed for the Dylan O'Brien...(especially dem glasses!)

The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3

Dylan O'Brien..... yum

1:08 Dylan!

i just watched the movie and checked the box office and man this should've done better like really better anyway this one made me wanna work for google, seriously they know how to sell their image , well i knew whole google building and the job itself  was cool but after watching this just made me say wow and really work somewhere like that , god who knows where i will end , after a month or something like that i have my collage exams coming and i really dont know how will i do, basicly this movie  sums up my whole fears right now , what collage i will get into(not that movie has anyhing to do with that subject yet it still has the connection to the smilar anxiety and fear), what kinda job i will pursue   and the whole shit that i am supposed to do for a better living and which is an idea that is pushed on us so this capitalist world order can live so in other words they suck our lives and in exchange  we get money which is directly used for to pretty ourselves up , like with better clothes , bigger house , better car , hotter bf , gf,wife ,husband or simply whole group of people who are there as long as we are at the top and dont get me wrong it is not that its a place i have ever been yet somehow the idea of getting better things are always engaced with that horrible portrait of a hollow soul....... god i dont know  why am i even writing this stuff , i guess as my dreams got bigger i just realized that they got emptier and right now i need to find my reason again to pursue my dream and this movie just made me so not that it has great deep meaning but still it gave me the start kick which is more than enough for now (i am so gonna regret that i ever posted this online )   

well i wanna ask whether dylan is like smart or he only choses smart roles to play not that it would make me like him less but  seriously do we get someone at last who has average iq with good looks because most of the time hotties in hollywood turns out to be  well total dumbass and it is not that all of them are but i am pretty sure most of them act like one when cameras are on  and even though what just i wrote might seem offensive  i'm still gonna write no offense

so unfunny 

BTW, for anyone who doesn't already know:  Google is in bed with both the CIA and the NSA (listed as a major 'data-provider' in the NSA's own training slides which you can view at Washington post.)

Hi there, NSA-Busters check this:  Ixquick.com  Euro-based search engine, 95% as effective as Google, keeps *nothing* on its servers, has NO connections with NSA or Euro-intelligence services.  Certfieid NSA-Free.  I use it constantly.  (Full disclosure: I have no financial or other relationship to this engine - I just use it.) 

Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google job

Heres why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy

What awful Google propaganda. This movie and the way they have screwed up youtube has really sullied googles name.

burnout paradise ost ;P

Two words...Xavier scene

Very unrealistic movie. Falsely represents Google. 

The movie was ok. I only watched it for Dylan O Brien and he did an a+ job. It does have terrible female representation. And 95% of the cast is white. But it was funny, but that probably all it has going for it.

Watching this just because of Dylan 

LOL all these fake comments....ridiculous. This movie wasn't that great just to let you know. 

thats the best comedy i have seen in a long time.
It should get a gooscar. LOL

This trailer was shown way to much before every video here on Youtube, and that drove me crazy!

Looks good.

i watched this movie with my friends and it's pretty good movie. it's funny,very funny,interesting,and just amazing. you should watch it! :D

Muito bom o filme. :-)

very enjoyable film,never mind the arsehole critics!

Alex Can suck a dick!

The general consensus is this movie is horrible and I must agree. It's written like a cheesy teen movie, but with added cursing and tits to make it R-rated. The plot points are so bad and and predictable. I maybe laughed once, and it was at something that wasn't even an intended joke. I made it to end of the movie... barely. Just because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were okay together in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean they should be pairing up to make another awful movie. Pretty fucking horrible.

so love this movie

This movie is by far the stupidest movie made.....EVER!  This movie makes these two main actor as a couple of individuals who do not nor will have  any acting skills.

I enjoyed the movie

Quite a good movie, love the Jib Jab presentation at the end lol

dyyyyyyylan

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. 

I NOW WANT TO WORK AT GOOGLE x LOL x i loved this film it was so funny x

this film was funny and so good sure who cares if it was a very long co-operate ad for google.but just look at political films and military films and shows like homeland sweeping in with thier agendas no one complains about that.i like how this film reflects the modern day and age of socitey im glad the film had other funny aspects and wasent to much about computors becuse then ppl would fail to understand and only computor geeks would get the jokes.however i think even my grandma enjoy this film as it wasent to hands on about technoligy and everyone coulde understand it.this is the only few technoligy computor like films that isent boring.there were no plot twists in the film however becuse they dont make much films like this it hard to tell what was going to happen anyways all the actors were good the story was good the jokes were funny so why not great film. 

Dylan O'Brien !!! <3
