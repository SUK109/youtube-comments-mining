i watched this movie it was epic loved it !!

A disappointing movie.

how can you miss it? you know for every marvel movie you have to stay after the credits to see a hint for the upcoming movies

Nice.

This is the best movie in the world u people gotta watch it

awesome

The best movie ever

This movie sucks to be honest. Only iron man fanboys would tell you it's good

I look amazing in that new suit

this was a huge disappointment. one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN!

one word -»»   WEAK

You'll love it alright. <3
Ironman is my new favorite superhero by Marvel. <3

hundreds thumb up

Plot holes? List some because apart from one or two I didn't see any connections any plot holes...

if you watch the thor movie trailer, you'll see that it's the same song :)

what is this, i missed it :(

song name plz


We need backup
Dats ur department
 Oh there mah boys :)

This movie SUCKS!!!!!

oh my god i didnt get to see whats after credits sby pls tell me

Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.


i watch this movie this movie is has a epic scene  and this movie is last movie 

Anyone who thought the dark knight rises sucked....you need to quit comics period....cut the shit please......the dark knight trilogy is the best ever comic book trilogy. ...im a marvel fan over dc.......the dark knight rises.....is zero % cheesy.....its as good as the dark knight...I have not seen iron man 3.....yet but im sure ill like it.....ghost rider 2...worst  comic book movie along with green Lantern. ....

Here's a question ! Didnt rohdey use the Mark2 to build War Machine A.K.A Iron Patriot 

Why did the Mark2 still exist ?

WANNA SEE IT

very movie i live it

you all should see ironman 3 low budget ,, very funny 

waiting for spider-man 2.And lego marvel superheroesvideo game

look at the reporters phone at 01:52 and than at 01:59

it transformed from old flip phone to new smart phone :-)


Robert Downey Jr looks young,...

no more iron man :(

credits were too long to wait. what was it?

Ughhhhhh i wanna watch this movie soooooooooo bad.

?????? ?????

This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!

The best part was the intro song. Who agrees?

nice....




amazinnnnnnnng movie i loved it

... And who cares about "the human face behind Iron Man", otherwise the movie should be called Tony  Stark.

yep, tht's mah boys >:D epic

I fell that Marvel Trolled me with the Mandarin! I was really disappointed about this movie! 

Why do you think that? Is it because it's more about the "hero" aspect and not the "super" aspect?

Marvel UK, YOU'LL NEVER SEE MEE SUBBIN'

Wait what? How?

Why are all the superhero movies ending!!!????

Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was okay, kinda disappointing.

then don't watch them you bozo! these are not made to win academy awards! 

I have to say I disagree with you, sir.

ITS BEEN SO AMAZINGGGGGGGGG WOH 

IAM JUST AN ACTOR 
MANDARINE HEHE

#IRONMAN 3

O_o so many suits


this trailer is not a movie 


this trailer is not a movie :D:D:D

This is more serious. This might actually be good

MAN OF STEEL IS THE REAL DEAL...

MAN OF STEEL'S GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK LIKE A CHILD'S ABC LESSON CLASS.


VERY DISAPPOINTED......

Theres no forth one

Man of steel will be better than this movie I guarantee it

This movie is polarizing opinions: some say it's great, others say it killed the franchise.
Some eve nsay it's more of the same(but not in a good way).
I'm a huge fan of the Iron-man films  released by marvel and I'm very curious about it. I can't wai to watch it!

How did you see it early?


I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original. 

So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.

Do NOT scroll down if you have not seen the movie

SuperMan and Pacific Rim are the only movies this summer worth seeing in theaters

the movie is so much funnier than how it looks in the trailer. actually at times it loses its credibility and becomes too much of a comedy, almost ridiculous but at least you get to laugh a lot and robert downey jr is a pleasure to watch!

I couldn't agree more. :D

Is it wrong for me to watch this, even if I have already watched the movie? o.O

What is it? I must of missed it :(

Can you please explain me about after credits cause i could not see it in cinema, they turned off it right after end of the movie. You can send me message ...

I know is was not a fight movie, but it was great!

Estubo muy buena la pelicula, no esperen mucha accion, o drama, pero si hay muchas risas y muchos efectos especiales. Estubo salvaje la pelicula.

hang on......you thought The Dark Knight Rises, was a bad movie?

Nice

this looks great but man of steel looks better


Am I the only one that thinks that while this trailer is awesome.. the film is kind of bad

see thats the problem people have today they want stuff thats strait out of the comic book and not a good story 

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

uhhh what?

Trevor Slattery is the best character ever. 

the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(

A really good movie! Im just wondering how did the other guy did wrom a chest blast but the other one didnt die wrom exploding in a suit

Im sorry but u dont belong here

My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?


Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.

just the way i like them!!!!

HD?!?!

omg. the mandarin is a joke

ironman 2 is pale in comparison to this one... it's just awesome.... and wait till the post credits scene, don't miss the big one...

I watched it today and it was good! I would buy the film online.

Is this 12+?!

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu madre
Buen video 

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu mdre

*disappointing

was very diappointing :(

I love U Robert Downey :)))

Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.

look at the reporters phone at 01:52 and than at 01:59

it transformed from old flip phone to new smart phone :-)


Robert Downey Jr looks young,...

no more iron man :(

credits were too long to wait. what was it?

Ughhhhhh i wanna watch this movie soooooooooo bad.

?????? ?????

This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!

The best part was the intro song. Who agrees?

nice....




amazinnnnnnnng movie i loved it

... And who cares about "the human face behind Iron Man", otherwise the movie should be called Tony  Stark.

yep, tht's mah boys >:D epic

I fell that Marvel Trolled me with the Mandarin! I was really disappointed about this movie! 

Why do you think that? Is it because it's more about the "hero" aspect and not the "super" aspect?

Marvel UK, YOU'LL NEVER SEE MEE SUBBIN'

Wait what? How?

Why are all the superhero movies ending!!!????

Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was okay, kinda disappointing.

then don't watch them you bozo! these are not made to win academy awards! 

I have to say I disagree with you, sir.

ITS BEEN SO AMAZINGGGGGGGGG WOH 

IAM JUST AN ACTOR 
MANDARINE HEHE

#IRONMAN 3

O_o so many suits


this trailer is not a movie 


this trailer is not a movie :D:D:D

This is more serious. This might actually be good

MAN OF STEEL IS THE REAL DEAL...

MAN OF STEEL'S GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK LIKE A CHILD'S ABC LESSON CLASS.


VERY DISAPPOINTED......

Theres no forth one

Man of steel will be better than this movie I guarantee it

This movie is polarizing opinions: some say it's great, others say it killed the franchise.
Some eve nsay it's more of the same(but not in a good way).
I'm a huge fan of the Iron-man films  released by marvel and I'm very curious about it. I can't wai to watch it!

How did you see it early?


I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original. 

So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.

Do NOT scroll down if you have not seen the movie

SuperMan and Pacific Rim are the only movies this summer worth seeing in theaters

the movie is so much funnier than how it looks in the trailer. actually at times it loses its credibility and becomes too much of a comedy, almost ridiculous but at least you get to laugh a lot and robert downey jr is a pleasure to watch!

I couldn't agree more. :D

Is it wrong for me to watch this, even if I have already watched the movie? o.O

What is it? I must of missed it :(

Can you please explain me about after credits cause i could not see it in cinema, they turned off it right after end of the movie. You can send me message ...

I know is was not a fight movie, but it was great!

Estubo muy buena la pelicula, no esperen mucha accion, o drama, pero si hay muchas risas y muchos efectos especiales. Estubo salvaje la pelicula.

hang on......you thought The Dark Knight Rises, was a bad movie?

Nice

this looks great but man of steel looks better


Am I the only one that thinks that while this trailer is awesome.. the film is kind of bad

see thats the problem people have today they want stuff thats strait out of the comic book and not a good story 

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

uhhh what?

Trevor Slattery is the best character ever. 

the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(

A really good movie! Im just wondering how did the other guy did wrom a chest blast but the other one didnt die wrom exploding in a suit

Im sorry but u dont belong here

My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?


Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.

just the way i like them!!!!

HD?!?!

omg. the mandarin is a joke

ironman 2 is pale in comparison to this one... it's just awesome.... and wait till the post credits scene, don't miss the big one...

I watched it today and it was good! I would buy the film online.

Is this 12+?!

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu madre
Buen video 

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu mdre

*disappointing

was very diappointing :(

I love U Robert Downey :)))

Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.

thanks mr. president

Pure awsomeness . 

longest Audi comercial ever.

i just watched iron man 3 last sunday and now i feel like want to see it again and again..


The rabbit at 1:20 lol

the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!

what that music? please

nice movie

galing ng movie na to. WATCH THIS IN 3D. AMAZING EFFECTS. 


The trailer shows the best parts of the movie. You can see the whole movie with this trailer. The rest of the movie sucks...

The trailer is better than the movie... The movie sucks 

there is something wrong with you.

1:52 using foldable phone
1:59 using iPhone

Why is War Machine painted like Iron Patriot?

Did he? Did he really save the day without his suits? He had 40 odd ones coming in and he got in 3 or 4 and Pepper saved the day really.

damn i missed that :/


i mssedd ittt :( please tell me what it was

He should have gotten in the HulkBuster :( 

It's not worth it

Poopy movie

They both are epic

I really hope there's an Iron Man 4, but I didn't understand what happened when he removed the shrapnel of his chest. I mean, did he close it so the arc reactor won't be there anymore like a part of him?
It should stay there, I'm not gonna find it nice if he doesn't need it in the chest anymore. As a excuse, Marvel should just say: "there's a hole in his chest, so why not keep the arc reactor in there, but without the shrapnel".

no one will ever replace rdj

I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.

ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.

For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies

the best thing is mandarin if you know what i mean

guys wait till after credits about 7 min and you will get a bonus scene

Jensen Ackles would make a great Iron Man

Nice Movie! Love it..Robert Downey Jr, just bring the fourth one please.

Good movie.  ..

you clearly did not understand what this movie was about it does not shatter the character it makes him stronger by showing that Tony can go in and save the day without his suits

true but i think it is okay to change the character powers if it is done correctly look at the Nolan Batman movies in those movies there are no super humans just Normal people Bane for example was just a body builder terrorist and did not have any of those venom tubs from the comics and Rahl al Gul instead of being a immortal man with magical power was just a guy who used chemical weapons so i am okay that the Mandarin had a new power it made him more interesting 

Such a nice movie

Good action comedy movie with a twist of drama but a disappointing and depressing Iron Man movie, this is how I feel after the movie... 3,000 Celcius girlfriend punch!!! and he's gone with a hole... dafuq...

Extremely good, awesome and very funny. Tony is still a sexy beast that can get you pregnant with his manliness.

This movie has the best version of The Mandarin.

It's weird watching the trailer after seeing the movie. Totally different experience than the trailer foreshadowed.

What is the name of the soundtrack in this trailer ? It's awesome :)


1:20 the Rabbit <3


wow dis is so lovely dem i love it


Guys this movie is epic 

Amazing movie (Y) Jarvis <3

Tony Stark was driving Audi e-tron in this trailer.

GUYS WAIT TILL AFTER CREDITS THERES SOMETHING THERE DONT MISS OUT!!! :D:D:D AMAZING MOVIE

I maybe the only one thinking this and people may hate me but i gotta say...I am kinda disappointed at this film...and saying "kinda" is me being polite...

while watching this movie i realised there was a loss of ACDC

Just watched it. Its really good. I like it

Better than the movie itself!

IRON MAN 3 SUCKED!!!!

i watched this the day it came out in the cinema its awesome if u haven"t watched do 

Just watched this movie today.. It's superb. Love it. Waiting for Thor 2 in cinemas..

This movie is madness, best trailer ever!!

great film. incredible mandarin twist.

 dissapointed mandarin 

My friend went to The Ellen show and got to see the whole movie before and she said it is  AMAZING!!!


i want that Dora watch limited edition.Lol

We Want Iron Man 4!!!

Awesome movie

Awesome!

The humor/action everything perfect!! definite watch! :)

If anyone is pondering whether to see this or not. You should. It is a very good film filled with action and loads of character development. Which is always a good thing.

You'll never see me coming... After watching the movie damn right I didn't

Ha ha ha ha, this video is soooo short of criticism, you MARVEL are obviously deleting posts, or not accepting a hell of a lot of them.

No they didnt, it made it funny.

Seriously they shouldn't tease about Mandarin. This movie is like a scam for all comic fans, or those who knows about Mandarin's power.

An amazing way to sell a product with an awesome and epic trailer, by inducing us to come to the cinema with the idea of enjoying a serious Iron man movie. And where the only thing you observe, is a nonsense film, which shatters the character of Iron Man, and becomes a mere mockery. Thank you to Marvel and Disney for this garbage, which is not Iron Man. Waiting for Joss Whedon and The Avengers 2. Please, forgive me for my English, I´m not native.


The movue us cool. I just dislike what they do to madrian

saw the movie today! it was AWESOME, full of ACTION!!!!

Saw it an Hour ago actions awesome , one liners awesome, RD jrs awesomeness Epic
It would've been a great movie without the Mandarin twist ..

Extremely overrated movie on Rotten Tomatoes due to their rating system. 

I like this movie, but I hate the fact that the Mandarin is what it is in the movie... One of the greatest villains in marvel universe, performed by a tremendous actor and they ruined it.. I'm dissapointed

Gonna see it today! CAN'T WAIT!

I don't like this movie because of one reason : They totally ruined Mandarin as a character and as Iron Man's nemesis..big disappointment.

To explain how badly the Mandarin has been screwed over  is impossible. But I'll explain it like this, what is seen of the so called "Mandarin" in the Iron Man 3 trailers is all you see of him properly in the movie. If you disagree with this then you are not an Iron Man fan because an Iron Man fan would know the Mandarin as one of Iron Man's most prominent enemies and therefore should be portrayed properly.
The villains and plot of this movie... horrible.

Can this BE any more cheesier? God. I like Robert Downey Jr. but the second one sucked and after watching this extremely cheesy trailer, I'm not entirely convinced this will be much better. Only an opinion before someone responds with 'oh you know nothing about anything', so yeah. I doubt anyone agrees but if they do, well that's awesome.

Iron Man 3 was perfect 10/10.

I watch this Official Trailer after Thailand type , lol 

nice

iron man fevvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So funny


I actually liked the twist during the film but then when I thought about it, they completely wasted the opportunity to have a great villain. 

youuuuuuuuu willllllllllll nnnnnnever ssseee meeeee coming

it sucked

we're going to watch Iron Man 3 movie tomorrow.. so excited..

stark again retunss...

saw it last night....great movie


The black guy looks like Louis from Left 4 Dead


2:20 cookies!!!!!!!!!!!    

That LOOKS soo sick.. gonna watch it today! :D

hav u seen the new thor 2 trailer 

FAILED :) HAHA ,, @0:56 & @2:00

Amazing movie

gag/a9boDVK (on 9gag)

I loved the movie, but i hated what they did with the mandarin.

Wrong, By Jarvis!!! :|

I love it

i watched this movie it was epic loved it !!

A disappointing movie.

how can you miss it? you know for every marvel movie you have to stay after the credits to see a hint for the upcoming movies

Nice.

This is the best movie in the world u people gotta watch it

awesome

The best movie ever

This movie sucks to be honest. Only iron man fanboys would tell you it's good

I look amazing in that new suit

this was a huge disappointment. one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN!

one word -»»   WEAK

You'll love it alright. <3
Ironman is my new favorite superhero by Marvel. <3

hundreds thumb up

Plot holes? List some because apart from one or two I didn't see any connections any plot holes...

if you watch the thor movie trailer, you'll see that it's the same song :)

what is this, i missed it :(

song name plz


We need backup
Dats ur department
 Oh there mah boys :)

This movie SUCKS!!!!!

oh my god i didnt get to see whats after credits sby pls tell me

Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.


i watch this movie this movie is has a epic scene  and this movie is last movie 

Anyone who thought the dark knight rises sucked....you need to quit comics period....cut the shit please......the dark knight trilogy is the best ever comic book trilogy. ...im a marvel fan over dc.......the dark knight rises.....is zero % cheesy.....its as good as the dark knight...I have not seen iron man 3.....yet but im sure ill like it.....ghost rider 2...worst  comic book movie along with green Lantern. ....

Here's a question ! Didnt rohdey use the Mark2 to build War Machine A.K.A Iron Patriot 

Why did the Mark2 still exist ?

WANNA SEE IT

very movie i live it

you all should see ironman 3 low budget ,, very funny

true but i think it is okay to change the character powers if it is done correctly look at the Nolan Batman movies in those movies there are no super humans just Normal people Bane for example was just a body builder terrorist and did not have any of those venom tubs from the comics and Rahl al Gul instead of being a immortal man with magical power was just a guy who used chemical weapons so i am okay that the Mandarin had a new power it made him more interesting 

Such a nice movie

Good action comedy movie with a twist of drama but a disappointing and depressing Iron Man movie, this is how I feel after the movie... 3,000 Celcius girlfriend punch!!! and he's gone with a hole... dafuq...

Extremely good, awesome and very funny. Tony is still a sexy beast that can get you pregnant with his manliness.

This movie has the best version of The Mandarin.

It's weird watching the trailer after seeing the movie. Totally different experience than the trailer foreshadowed.

What is the name of the soundtrack in this trailer ? It's awesome :)


1:20 the Rabbit <3


wow dis is so lovely dem i love it


Guys this movie is epic 

Amazing movie (Y) Jarvis <3

Tony Stark was driving Audi e-tron in this trailer.

GUYS WAIT TILL AFTER CREDITS THERES SOMETHING THERE DONT MISS OUT!!! :D:D:D AMAZING MOVIE

I maybe the only one thinking this and people may hate me but i gotta say...I am kinda disappointed at this film...and saying "kinda" is me being polite...

while watching this movie i realised there was a loss of ACDC

Just watched it. Its really good. I like it

Better than the movie itself!

IRON MAN 3 SUCKED!!!!

i watched this the day it came out in the cinema its awesome if u haven"t watched do 

Just watched this movie today.. It's superb. Love it. Waiting for Thor 2 in cinemas..

This movie is madness, best trailer ever!!

great film. incredible mandarin twist.

 dissapointed mandarin 

My friend went to The Ellen show and got to see the whole movie before and she said it is  AMAZING!!!


i want that Dora watch limited edition.Lol

We Want Iron Man 4!!!

Awesome movie

Awesome!

The humor/action everything perfect!! definite watch! :)

If anyone is pondering whether to see this or not. You should. It is a very good film filled with action and loads of character development. Which is always a good thing.

You'll never see me coming... After watching the movie damn right I didn't

Ha ha ha ha, this video is soooo short of criticism, you MARVEL are obviously deleting posts, or not accepting a hell of a lot of them.

No they didnt, it made it funny.

Seriously they shouldn't tease about Mandarin. This movie is like a scam for all comic fans, or those who knows about Mandarin's power.

An amazing way to sell a product with an awesome and epic trailer, by inducing us to come to the cinema with the idea of enjoying a serious Iron man movie. And where the only thing you observe, is a nonsense film, which shatters the character of Iron Man, and becomes a mere mockery. Thank you to Marvel and Disney for this garbage, which is not Iron Man. Waiting for Joss Whedon and The Avengers 2. Please, forgive me for my English, I´m not native.


The movue us cool. I just dislike what they do to madrian

saw the movie today! it was AWESOME, full of ACTION!!!!

Saw it an Hour ago actions awesome , one liners awesome, RD jrs awesomeness Epic
It would've been a great movie without the Mandarin twist ..

Extremely overrated movie on Rotten Tomatoes due to their rating system. 

I like this movie, but I hate the fact that the Mandarin is what it is in the movie... One of the greatest villains in marvel universe, performed by a tremendous actor and they ruined it.. I'm dissapointed

Gonna see it today! CAN'T WAIT!

I don't like this movie because of one reason : They totally ruined Mandarin as a character and as Iron Man's nemesis..big disappointment.

To explain how badly the Mandarin has been screwed over  is impossible. But I'll explain it like this, what is seen of the so called "Mandarin" in the Iron Man 3 trailers is all you see of him properly in the movie. If you disagree with this then you are not an Iron Man fan because an Iron Man fan would know the Mandarin as one of Iron Man's most prominent enemies and therefore should be portrayed properly.
The villains and plot of this movie... horrible.

Can this BE any more cheesier? God. I like Robert Downey Jr. but the second one sucked and after watching this extremely cheesy trailer, I'm not entirely convinced this will be much better. Only an opinion before someone responds with 'oh you know nothing about anything', so yeah. I doubt anyone agrees but if they do, well that's awesome.

Iron Man 3 was perfect 10/10.

I watch this Official Trailer after Thailand type , lol 

nice

iron man fevvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So funny


I actually liked the twist during the film but then when I thought about it, they completely wasted the opportunity to have a great villain. 

youuuuuuuuu willllllllllll nnnnnnever ssseee meeeee coming

it sucked

we're going to watch Iron Man 3 movie tomorrow.. so excited..

stark again retunss...

saw it last night....great movie


The black guy looks like Louis from Left 4 Dead


2:20 cookies!!!!!!!!!!!    

That LOOKS soo sick.. gonna watch it today! :D

hav u seen the new thor 2 trailer 

FAILED :) HAHA ,, @0:56 & @2:00

ok now lets watch it

the movie was awesome

I'm gonna watch it today with a couple of mates! Can't wait! The first 2 films were great, so was the Avengers Assemble! Go Marvel!

great //////////////////???????????..........

Amazing movie

gag/a9boDVK (on 9gag)
-explains the cost of being iron man

its just wow,......best of all gonna watch it 2 day..


I loved the movie, but i hated what they did with the mandarin.

Wrong, By Jarvis!!! :|

I love it

Pure awsomeness . 

longest Audi comercial ever.

i just watched iron man 3 last sunday and now i feel like want to see it again and again..


The rabbit at 1:20 lol

the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!

what that music? please

nice movie

galing ng movie na to. WATCH THIS IN 3D. AMAZING EFFECTS. 


The trailer shows the best parts of the movie. You can see the whole movie with this trailer. The rest of the movie sucks...

The trailer is better than the movie... The movie sucks 

there is something wrong with you.

1:52 using foldable phone
1:59 using iPhone

Why is War Machine painted like Iron Patriot?

Did he? Did he really save the day without his suits? He had 40 odd ones coming in and he got in 3 or 4 and Pepper saved the day really.

damn i missed that :/


i mssedd ittt :( please tell me what it was

He should have gotten in the HulkBuster :( 

It's not worth it

Poopy movie

They both are epic

I really hope there's an Iron Man 4, but I didn't understand what happened when he removed the shrapnel of his chest. I mean, did he close it so the arc reactor won't be there anymore like a part of him?
It should stay there, I'm not gonna find it nice if he doesn't need it in the chest anymore. As a excuse, Marvel should just say: "there's a hole in his chest, so why not keep the arc reactor in there, but without the shrapnel".

no one will ever replace rdj

I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.

ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.

For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies

the best thing is mandarin if you know what i mean

guys wait till after credits about 7 min and you will get a bonus scene

Jensen Ackles would make a great Iron Man

Nice Movie! Love it..Robert Downey Jr, just bring the fourth one please.

Good movie.  ..

you clearly did not understand what this movie was about it does not shatter the character it makes him stronger by showing that Tony can go in and save the day without his suits

i watched this movie it was epic loved it !!

A disappointing movie.

how can you miss it? you know for every marvel movie you have to stay after the credits to see a hint for the upcoming movies

Nice.

This is the best movie in the world u people gotta watch it

awesome

The best movie ever

This movie sucks to be honest. Only iron man fanboys would tell you it's good

I look amazing in that new suit

this was a huge disappointment. one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN!

one word -»»   WEAK

You'll love it alright. <3
Ironman is my new favorite superhero by Marvel. <3

hundreds thumb up

Plot holes? List some because apart from one or two I didn't see any connections any plot holes...

if you watch the thor movie trailer, you'll see that it's the same song :)

what is this, i missed it :(

song name plz


We need backup
Dats ur department
 Oh there mah boys :)

This movie SUCKS!!!!!

oh my god i didnt get to see whats after credits sby pls tell me

Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.


i watch this movie this movie is has a epic scene  and this movie is last movie 

Anyone who thought the dark knight rises sucked....you need to quit comics period....cut the shit please......the dark knight trilogy is the best ever comic book trilogy. ...im a marvel fan over dc.......the dark knight rises.....is zero % cheesy.....its as good as the dark knight...I have not seen iron man 3.....yet but im sure ill like it.....ghost rider 2...worst  comic book movie along with green Lantern. ....

Here's a question ! Didnt rohdey use the Mark2 to build War Machine A.K.A Iron Patriot 

Why did the Mark2 still exist ?

WANNA SEE IT

very movie i live it

you all should see ironman 3 low budget ,, very funny 

waiting for spider-man 2.And lego marvel superheroesvideo game

look at the reporters phone at 01:52 and than at 01:59

it transformed from old flip phone to new smart phone :-)


Robert Downey Jr looks young,...

no more iron man :(

credits were too long to wait. what was it?

Ughhhhhh i wanna watch this movie soooooooooo bad.

?????? ?????

This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!

The best part was the intro song. Who agrees?

nice....




amazinnnnnnnng movie i loved it

... And who cares about "the human face behind Iron Man", otherwise the movie should be called Tony  Stark.

yep, tht's mah boys >:D epic

I fell that Marvel Trolled me with the Mandarin! I was really disappointed about this movie! 

Why do you think that? Is it because it's more about the "hero" aspect and not the "super" aspect?

Marvel UK, YOU'LL NEVER SEE MEE SUBBIN'

Wait what? How?

Why are all the superhero movies ending!!!????

Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was okay, kinda disappointing.

then don't watch them you bozo! these are not made to win academy awards! 

I have to say I disagree with you, sir.

ITS BEEN SO AMAZINGGGGGGGGG WOH 

IAM JUST AN ACTOR 
MANDARINE HEHE

#IRONMAN 3

O_o so many suits


this trailer is not a movie 


this trailer is not a movie :D:D:D

This is more serious. This might actually be good

MAN OF STEEL IS THE REAL DEAL...

MAN OF STEEL'S GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK LIKE A CHILD'S ABC LESSON CLASS.


VERY DISAPPOINTED......

Theres no forth one

Man of steel will be better than this movie I guarantee it

This movie is polarizing opinions: some say it's great, others say it killed the franchise.
Some eve nsay it's more of the same(but not in a good way).
I'm a huge fan of the Iron-man films  released by marvel and I'm very curious about it. I can't wai to watch it!

How did you see it early?


I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original. 

So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.

Do NOT scroll down if you have not seen the movie

SuperMan and Pacific Rim are the only movies this summer worth seeing in theaters

the movie is so much funnier than how it looks in the trailer. actually at times it loses its credibility and becomes too much of a comedy, almost ridiculous but at least you get to laugh a lot and robert downey jr is a pleasure to watch!

I couldn't agree more. :D

Is it wrong for me to watch this, even if I have already watched the movie? o.O

What is it? I must of missed it :(

Can you please explain me about after credits cause i could not see it in cinema, they turned off it right after end of the movie. You can send me message ...

I know is was not a fight movie, but it was great!

Estubo muy buena la pelicula, no esperen mucha accion, o drama, pero si hay muchas risas y muchos efectos especiales. Estubo salvaje la pelicula.

hang on......you thought The Dark Knight Rises, was a bad movie?

Nice

this looks great but man of steel looks better


Am I the only one that thinks that while this trailer is awesome.. the film is kind of bad

see thats the problem people have today they want stuff thats strait out of the comic book and not a good story 

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

uhhh what?

Trevor Slattery is the best character ever. 

the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(

A really good movie! Im just wondering how did the other guy did wrom a chest blast but the other one didnt die wrom exploding in a suit

Im sorry but u dont belong here

My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?


Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.

just the way i like them!!!!

HD?!?!

omg. the mandarin is a joke

ironman 2 is pale in comparison to this one... it's just awesome.... and wait till the post credits scene, don't miss the big one...

I watched it today and it was good! I would buy the film online.

Is this 12+?!

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu madre
Buen video 

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu mdre

*disappointing

was very diappointing :(

I love U Robert Downey :)))

Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.

thanks mr. president

Jensen Ackles would make a great Iron Man

Nice Movie! Love it..Robert Downey Jr, just bring the fourth one please.

Good movie.  ..

you clearly did not understand what this movie was about it does not shatter the character it makes him stronger by showing that Tony can go in and save the day without his suits

true but i think it is okay to change the character powers if it is done correctly look at the Nolan Batman movies in those movies there are no super humans just Normal people Bane for example was just a body builder terrorist and did not have any of those venom tubs from the comics and Rahl al Gul instead of being a immortal man with magical power was just a guy who used chemical weapons so i am okay that the Mandarin had a new power it made him more interesting 

Such a nice movie

Good action comedy movie with a twist of drama but a disappointing and depressing Iron Man movie, this is how I feel after the movie... 3,000 Celcius girlfriend punch!!! and he's gone with a hole... dafuq...

Extremely good, awesome and very funny. Tony is still a sexy beast that can get you pregnant with his manliness.

This movie has the best version of The Mandarin.

It's weird watching the trailer after seeing the movie. Totally different experience than the trailer foreshadowed.

What is the name of the soundtrack in this trailer ? It's awesome :)


1:20 the Rabbit <3


wow dis is so lovely dem i love it


Guys this movie is epic 

Amazing movie (Y) Jarvis <3

Tony Stark was driving Audi e-tron in this trailer.

GUYS WAIT TILL AFTER CREDITS THERES SOMETHING THERE DONT MISS OUT!!! :D:D:D AMAZING MOVIE

I maybe the only one thinking this and people may hate me but i gotta say...I am kinda disappointed at this film...and saying "kinda" is me being polite...

while watching this movie i realised there was a loss of ACDC

Just watched it. Its really good. I like it

Better than the movie itself!

IRON MAN 3 SUCKED!!!!

i watched this the day it came out in the cinema its awesome if u haven"t watched do 

Just watched this movie today.. It's superb. Love it. Waiting for Thor 2 in cinemas..

This movie is madness, best trailer ever!!

great film. incredible mandarin twist.

 dissapointed mandarin 

My friend went to The Ellen show and got to see the whole movie before and she said it is  AMAZING!!!


i want that Dora watch limited edition.Lol

We Want Iron Man 4!!!

Awesome movie

Awesome!

The humor/action everything perfect!! definite watch! :)

If anyone is pondering whether to see this or not. You should. It is a very good film filled with action and loads of character development. Which is always a good thing.

You'll never see me coming... After watching the movie damn right I didn't

Ha ha ha ha, this video is soooo short of criticism, you MARVEL are obviously deleting posts, or not accepting a hell of a lot of them.

No they didnt, it made it funny.

Seriously they shouldn't tease about Mandarin. This movie is like a scam for all comic fans, or those who knows about Mandarin's power.

An amazing way to sell a product with an awesome and epic trailer, by inducing us to come to the cinema with the idea of enjoying a serious Iron man movie. And where the only thing you observe, is a nonsense film, which shatters the character of Iron Man, and becomes a mere mockery. Thank you to Marvel and Disney for this garbage, which is not Iron Man. Waiting for Joss Whedon and The Avengers 2. Please, forgive me for my English, I´m not native.


The movue us cool. I just dislike what they do to madrian

saw the movie today! it was AWESOME, full of ACTION!!!!

Saw it an Hour ago actions awesome , one liners awesome, RD jrs awesomeness Epic
It would've been a great movie without the Mandarin twist ..

Extremely overrated movie on Rotten Tomatoes due to their rating system. 

I like this movie, but I hate the fact that the Mandarin is what it is in the movie... One of the greatest villains in marvel universe, performed by a tremendous actor and they ruined it.. I'm dissapointed

Gonna see it today! CAN'T WAIT!

I don't like this movie because of one reason : They totally ruined Mandarin as a character and as Iron Man's nemesis..big disappointment.

To explain how badly the Mandarin has been screwed over  is impossible. But I'll explain it like this, what is seen of the so called "Mandarin" in the Iron Man 3 trailers is all you see of him properly in the movie. If you disagree with this then you are not an Iron Man fan because an Iron Man fan would know the Mandarin as one of Iron Man's most prominent enemies and therefore should be portrayed properly.
The villains and plot of this movie... horrible.

Can this BE any more cheesier? God. I like Robert Downey Jr. but the second one sucked and after watching this extremely cheesy trailer, I'm not entirely convinced this will be much better. Only an opinion before someone responds with 'oh you know nothing about anything', so yeah. I doubt anyone agrees but if they do, well that's awesome.

Iron Man 3 was perfect 10/10.

I watch this Official Trailer after Thailand type , lol 

nice

iron man fevvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So funny


I actually liked the twist during the film but then when I thought about it, they completely wasted the opportunity to have a great villain. 

youuuuuuuuu willllllllllll nnnnnnever ssseee meeeee coming

it sucked

we're going to watch Iron Man 3 movie tomorrow.. so excited..

stark again retunss...

saw it last night....great movie


The black guy looks like Louis from Left 4 Dead


2:20 cookies!!!!!!!!!!!    

That LOOKS soo sick.. gonna watch it today! :D

hav u seen the new thor 2 trailer 

FAILED :) HAHA ,, @0:56 & @2:00

ok now lets watch it

the movie was awesome

I'm gonna watch it today with a couple of mates! Can't wait! The first 2 films were great, so was the Avengers Assemble! Go Marvel!

great //////////////////???????????..........

Amazing movie

gag/a9boDVK (on 9gag)
-explains the cost of being iron man

its just wow,......best of all gonna watch it 2 day..


I loved the movie, but i hated what they did with the mandarin.

Wrong, By Jarvis!!! :|

I love it

Pure awsomeness . 

longest Audi comercial ever.

i just watched iron man 3 last sunday and now i feel like want to see it again and again..


The rabbit at 1:20 lol

the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!

what that music? please

nice movie

galing ng movie na to. WATCH THIS IN 3D. AMAZING EFFECTS. 


The trailer shows the best parts of the movie. You can see the whole movie with this trailer. The rest of the movie sucks...

The trailer is better than the movie... The movie sucks 

there is something wrong with you.

1:52 using foldable phone
1:59 using iPhone

Why is War Machine painted like Iron Patriot?

Did he? Did he really save the day without his suits? He had 40 odd ones coming in and he got in 3 or 4 and Pepper saved the day really.

damn i missed that :/


i mssedd ittt :( please tell me what it was

He should have gotten in the HulkBuster :( 

It's not worth it

Poopy movie

They both are epic

I really hope there's an Iron Man 4, but I didn't understand what happened when he removed the shrapnel of his chest. I mean, did he close it so the arc reactor won't be there anymore like a part of him?
It should stay there, I'm not gonna find it nice if he doesn't need it in the chest anymore. As a excuse, Marvel should just say: "there's a hole in his chest, so why not keep the arc reactor in there, but without the shrapnel".

no one will ever replace rdj

I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.

ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.

For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies

the best thing is mandarin if you know what i mean

guys wait till after credits about 7 min and you will get a bonus scene

Jensen Ackles would make a great Iron Man

Nice Movie! Love it..Robert Downey Jr, just bring the fourth one please.

Good movie.  ..

you clearly did not understand what this movie was about it does not shatter the character it makes him stronger by showing that Tony can go in and save the day without his suits

true but i think it is okay to change the character powers if it is done correctly look at the Nolan Batman movies in those movies there are no super humans just Normal people Bane for example was just a body builder terrorist and did not have any of those venom tubs from the comics and Rahl al Gul instead of being a immortal man with magical power was just a guy who used chemical weapons so i am okay that the Mandarin had a new power it made him more interesting 

Such a nice movie

Good action comedy movie with a twist of drama but a disappointing and depressing Iron Man movie, this is how I feel after the movie... 3,000 Celcius girlfriend punch!!! and he's gone with a hole... dafuq...

Extremely good, awesome and very funny. Tony is still a sexy beast that can get you pregnant with his manliness.

This movie has the best version of The Mandarin.

Nice.

This is the best movie in the world u people gotta watch it

The best movie ever

This movie sucks to be honest. Only iron man fanboys would tell you it's good

I look amazing in that new suit

this was a huge disappointment. one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN!

one word -»»   WEAK

You'll love it alright. <3
Ironman is my new favorite superhero by Marvel. <3

hundreds thumb up

Plot holes? List some because apart from one or two I didn't see any connections any plot holes...

if you watch the thor movie trailer, you'll see that it's the same song :)

what is this, i missed it :(

song name plz


We need backup
Dats ur department
 Oh there mah boys :)

This movie SUCKS!!!!!

oh my god i didnt get to see whats after credits sby pls tell me

Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.


i watch this movie this movie is has a epic scene  and this movie is last movie 

Anyone who thought the dark knight rises sucked....you need to quit comics period....cut the shit please......the dark knight trilogy is the best ever comic book trilogy. ...im a marvel fan over dc.......the dark knight rises.....is zero % cheesy.....its as good as the dark knight...I have not seen iron man 3.....yet but im sure ill like it.....ghost rider 2...worst  comic book movie along with green Lantern. ....

Here's a question ! Didnt rohdey use the Mark2 to build War Machine A.K.A Iron Patriot 

Why did the Mark2 still exist ?

WANNA SEE IT

very movie i live it

you all should see ironman 3 low budget ,, very funny 

waiting for spider-man 2.And lego marvel superheroesvideo game

look at the reporters phone at 01:52 and than at 01:59

it transformed from old flip phone to new smart phone :-)


Robert Downey Jr looks young,...

no more iron man :(

credits were too long to wait. what was it?

Ughhhhhh i wanna watch this movie soooooooooo bad.

?????? ?????

This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!

The best part was the intro song. Who agrees?

nice....




amazinnnnnnnng movie i loved it

... And who cares about "the human face behind Iron Man", otherwise the movie should be called Tony  Stark.

yep, tht's mah boys >:D epic

I fell that Marvel Trolled me with the Mandarin! I was really disappointed about this movie! 

Why do you think that? Is it because it's more about the "hero" aspect and not the "super" aspect?

Marvel UK, YOU'LL NEVER SEE MEE SUBBIN'

Wait what? How?

Why are all the superhero movies ending!!!????

Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was okay, kinda disappointing.

then don't watch them you bozo! these are not made to win academy awards! 

I have to say I disagree with you, sir.

ITS BEEN SO AMAZINGGGGGGGGG WOH 

IAM JUST AN ACTOR 
MANDARINE HEHE

#IRONMAN 3

O_o so many suits


this trailer is not a movie 


this trailer is not a movie :D:D:D

This is more serious. This might actually be good

MAN OF STEEL IS THE REAL DEAL...

MAN OF STEEL'S GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK LIKE A CHILD'S ABC LESSON CLASS.


VERY DISAPPOINTED......

Theres no forth one

Man of steel will be better than this movie I guarantee it

This movie is polarizing opinions: some say it's great, others say it killed the franchise.
Some eve nsay it's more of the same(but not in a good way).
I'm a huge fan of the Iron-man films  released by marvel and I'm very curious about it. I can't wai to watch it!

How did you see it early?


I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original. 

So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.

Do NOT scroll down if you have not seen the movie

SuperMan and Pacific Rim are the only movies this summer worth seeing in theaters

the movie is so much funnier than how it looks in the trailer. actually at times it loses its credibility and becomes too much of a comedy, almost ridiculous but at least you get to laugh a lot and robert downey jr is a pleasure to watch!

I couldn't agree more. :D

Is it wrong for me to watch this, even if I have already watched the movie? o.O

What is it? I must of missed it :(

Can you please explain me about after credits cause i could not see it in cinema, they turned off it right after end of the movie. You can send me message ...

I know is was not a fight movie, but it was great!

Estubo muy buena la pelicula, no esperen mucha accion, o drama, pero si hay muchas risas y muchos efectos especiales. Estubo salvaje la pelicula.

hang on......you thought The Dark Knight Rises, was a bad movie?

Nice

this looks great but man of steel looks better


Am I the only one that thinks that while this trailer is awesome.. the film is kind of bad

see thats the problem people have today they want stuff thats strait out of the comic book and not a good story 

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

uhhh what?

Trevor Slattery is the best character ever. 

the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(

A really good movie! Im just wondering how did the other guy did wrom a chest blast but the other one didnt die wrom exploding in a suit

Im sorry but u dont belong here

My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?


Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.

just the way i like them!!!!

HD?!?!

omg. the mandarin is a joke

ironman 2 is pale in comparison to this one... it's just awesome.... and wait till the post credits scene, don't miss the big one...

I watched it today and it was good! I would buy the film online.

Is this 12+?!

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu madre
Buen video 

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu mdre

*disappointing

was very diappointing :(

I love U Robert Downey :)))

Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.

thanks mr. president

i watched this movie it was epic loved it !!

A disappointing movie.

how can you miss it? you know for every marvel movie you have to stay after the credits to see a hint for the upcoming movies

Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.


i watch this movie this movie is has a epic scene  and this movie is last movie 

Anyone who thought the dark knight rises sucked....you need to quit comics period....cut the shit please......the dark knight trilogy is the best ever comic book trilogy. ...im a marvel fan over dc.......the dark knight rises.....is zero % cheesy.....its as good as the dark knight...I have not seen iron man 3.....yet but im sure ill like it.....ghost rider 2...worst  comic book movie along with green Lantern. ....

Here's a question ! Didnt rohdey use the Mark2 to build War Machine A.K.A Iron Patriot 

Why did the Mark2 still exist ?

WANNA SEE IT

very movie i live it

you all should see ironman 3 low budget ,, very funny 

waiting for spider-man 2.And lego marvel superheroesvideo game

look at the reporters phone at 01:52 and than at 01:59

it transformed from old flip phone to new smart phone :-)


Robert Downey Jr looks young,...

no more iron man :(

credits were too long to wait. what was it?

Ughhhhhh i wanna watch this movie soooooooooo bad.

?????? ?????

This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!

The best part was the intro song. Who agrees?

nice....




amazinnnnnnnng movie i loved it

... And who cares about "the human face behind Iron Man", otherwise the movie should be called Tony  Stark.

yep, tht's mah boys >:D epic

I fell that Marvel Trolled me with the Mandarin! I was really disappointed about this movie! 

Why do you think that? Is it because it's more about the "hero" aspect and not the "super" aspect?

Marvel UK, YOU'LL NEVER SEE MEE SUBBIN'

Wait what? How?

Why are all the superhero movies ending!!!????

Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was okay, kinda disappointing.

then don't watch them you bozo! these are not made to win academy awards! 

I have to say I disagree with you, sir.

ITS BEEN SO AMAZINGGGGGGGGG WOH 

IAM JUST AN ACTOR 
MANDARINE HEHE

#IRONMAN 3

O_o so many suits


this trailer is not a movie 


this trailer is not a movie :D:D:D

This is more serious. This might actually be good

MAN OF STEEL IS THE REAL DEAL...

MAN OF STEEL'S GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK LIKE A CHILD'S ABC LESSON CLASS.


VERY DISAPPOINTED......

Theres no forth one

Man of steel will be better than this movie I guarantee it

This movie is polarizing opinions: some say it's great, others say it killed the franchise.
Some eve nsay it's more of the same(but not in a good way).
I'm a huge fan of the Iron-man films  released by marvel and I'm very curious about it. I can't wai to watch it!

How did you see it early?


I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original. 

So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.

Do NOT scroll down if you have not seen the movie

SuperMan and Pacific Rim are the only movies this summer worth seeing in theaters

the movie is so much funnier than how it looks in the trailer. actually at times it loses its credibility and becomes too much of a comedy, almost ridiculous but at least you get to laugh a lot and robert downey jr is a pleasure to watch!

I couldn't agree more. :D

Is it wrong for me to watch this, even if I have already watched the movie? o.O

What is it? I must of missed it :(

Can you please explain me about after credits cause i could not see it in cinema, they turned off it right after end of the movie. You can send me message ...

I know is was not a fight movie, but it was great!

Estubo muy buena la pelicula, no esperen mucha accion, o drama, pero si hay muchas risas y muchos efectos especiales. Estubo salvaje la pelicula.

hang on......you thought The Dark Knight Rises, was a bad movie?

Nice

this looks great but man of steel looks better


Am I the only one that thinks that while this trailer is awesome.. the film is kind of bad

see thats the problem people have today they want stuff thats strait out of the comic book and not a good story 

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!

one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

uhhh what?

Trevor Slattery is the best character ever. 

the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(

A really good movie! Im just wondering how did the other guy did wrom a chest blast but the other one didnt die wrom exploding in a suit

Im sorry but u dont belong here

My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?


Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.

just the way i like them!!!!

HD?!?!

omg. the mandarin is a joke

ironman 2 is pale in comparison to this one... it's just awesome.... and wait till the post credits scene, don't miss the big one...

I watched it today and it was good! I would buy the film online.

Is this 12+?!

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu madre
Buen video 

ya lo vi no es tan buena vean asu mdre

*disappointing

was very diappointing :(

I love U Robert Downey :)))

Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.

thanks mr. president

Pure awsomeness . 

longest Audi comercial ever.

i just watched iron man 3 last sunday and now i feel like want to see it again and again..


The rabbit at 1:20 lol

the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!

what that music? please

nice movie

galing ng movie na to. WATCH THIS IN 3D. AMAZING EFFECTS. 


The trailer shows the best parts of the movie. You can see the whole movie with this trailer. The rest of the movie sucks...

The trailer is better than the movie... The movie sucks 

there is something wrong with you.

1:52 using foldable phone
1:59 using iPhone

Why is War Machine painted like Iron Patriot?

Did he? Did he really save the day without his suits? He had 40 odd ones coming in and he got in 3 or 4 and Pepper saved the day really.

damn i missed that :/


i mssedd ittt :( please tell me what it was

He should have gotten in the HulkBuster :( 

It's not worth it

Poopy movie

They both are epic

I really hope there's an Iron Man 4, but I didn't understand what happened when he removed the shrapnel of his chest. I mean, did he close it so the arc reactor won't be there anymore like a part of him?
It should stay there, I'm not gonna find it nice if he doesn't need it in the chest anymore. As a excuse, Marvel should just say: "there's a hole in his chest, so why not keep the arc reactor in there, but without the shrapnel".

no one will ever replace rdj

I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.

ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.

For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies

the best thing is mandarin if you know what i mean

guys wait till after credits about 7 min and you will get a bonus scene

Jensen Ackles would make a great Iron Man

Nice Movie! Love it..Robert Downey Jr, just bring the fourth one please.

Good movie.  ..

you clearly did not understand what this movie was about it does not shatter the character it makes him stronger by showing that Tony can go in and save the day without his suits

true but i think it is okay to change the character powers if it is done correctly look at the Nolan Batman movies in those movies there are no super humans just Normal people Bane for example was just a body builder terrorist and did not have any of those venom tubs from the comics and Rahl al Gul instead of being a immortal man with magical power was just a guy who used chemical weapons so i am okay that the Mandarin had a new power it made him more interesting 

Such a nice movie

Good action comedy movie with a twist of drama but a disappointing and depressing Iron Man movie, this is how I feel after the movie... 3,000 Celcius girlfriend punch!!! and he's gone with a hole... dafuq...

Extremely good, awesome and very funny. Tony is still a sexy beast that can get you pregnant with his manliness.

This movie has the best version of The Mandarin.

It's weird watching the trailer after seeing the movie. Totally different experience than the trailer foreshadowed.

What is the name of the soundtrack in this trailer ? It's awesome :)


1:20 the Rabbit <3


wow dis is so lovely dem i love it


Guys this movie is epic 

Amazing movie (Y) Jarvis <3

Tony Stark was driving Audi e-tron in this trailer.

GUYS WAIT TILL AFTER CREDITS THERES SOMETHING THERE DONT MISS OUT!!! :D:D:D AMAZING MOVIE

I maybe the only one thinking this and people may hate me but i gotta say...I am kinda disappointed at this film...and saying "kinda" is me being polite...

while watching this movie i realised there was a loss of ACDC

Just watched it. Its really good. I like it

Better than the movie itself!

IRON MAN 3 SUCKED!!!!

i watched this the day it came out in the cinema its awesome if u haven"t watched do 

Just watched this movie today.. It's superb. Love it. Waiting for Thor 2 in cinemas..

This movie is madness, best trailer ever!!

great film. incredible mandarin twist.

 dissapointed mandarin 

My friend went to The Ellen show and got to see the whole movie before and she said it is  AMAZING!!!


i want that Dora watch limited edition.Lol

We Want Iron Man 4!!!

Awesome movie

Awesome!

The humor/action everything perfect!! definite watch! :)

If anyone is pondering whether to see this or not. You should. It is a very good film filled with action and loads of character development. Which is always a good thing.

You'll never see me coming... After watching the movie damn right I didn't

Ha ha ha ha, this video is soooo short of criticism, you MARVEL are obviously deleting posts, or not accepting a hell of a lot of them.

No they didnt, it made it funny.

Seriously they shouldn't tease about Mandarin. This movie is like a scam for all comic fans, or those who knows about Mandarin's power.

An amazing way to sell a product with an awesome and epic trailer, by inducing us to come to the cinema with the idea of enjoying a serious Iron man movie. And where the only thing you observe, is a nonsense film, which shatters the character of Iron Man, and becomes a mere mockery. Thank you to Marvel and Disney for this garbage, which is not Iron Man. Waiting for Joss Whedon and The Avengers 2. Please, forgive me for my English, I´m not native.


The movue us cool. I just dislike what they do to madrian

saw the movie today! it was AWESOME, full of ACTION!!!!

Saw it an Hour ago actions awesome , one liners awesome, RD jrs awesomeness Epic
It would've been a great movie without the Mandarin twist ..

Extremely overrated movie on Rotten Tomatoes due to their rating system. 

I like this movie, but I hate the fact that the Mandarin is what it is in the movie... One of the greatest villains in marvel universe, performed by a tremendous actor and they ruined it.. I'm dissapointed

Gonna see it today! CAN'T WAIT!

I don't like this movie because of one reason : They totally ruined Mandarin as a character and as Iron Man's nemesis..big disappointment.

To explain how badly the Mandarin has been screwed over  is impossible. But I'll explain it like this, what is seen of the so called "Mandarin" in the Iron Man 3 trailers is all you see of him properly in the movie. If you disagree with this then you are not an Iron Man fan because an Iron Man fan would know the Mandarin as one of Iron Man's most prominent enemies and therefore should be portrayed properly.
The villains and plot of this movie... horrible.

Can this BE any more cheesier? God. I like Robert Downey Jr. but the second one sucked and after watching this extremely cheesy trailer, I'm not entirely convinced this will be much better. Only an opinion before someone responds with 'oh you know nothing about anything', so yeah. I doubt anyone agrees but if they do, well that's awesome.

Iron Man 3 was perfect 10/10.

I watch this Official Trailer after Thailand type , lol 

nice

iron man fevvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So funny


I actually liked the twist during the film but then when I thought about it, they completely wasted the opportunity to have a great villain. 

youuuuuuuuu willllllllllll nnnnnnever ssseee meeeee coming

it sucked

we're going to watch Iron Man 3 movie tomorrow.. so excited..

stark again retunss...

saw it last night....great movie


The black guy looks like Louis from Left 4 Dead
