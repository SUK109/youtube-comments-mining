this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Starring: POUTY FACE

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Starring: POUTY FACE

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Starring: POUTY FACE

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

esta buena esta película? 
se me hace una mamada que sea padre e hijo, por eso pregunto.

this movie has powerful messages ... danger is real... fear is an illusion, fear is a choice
Is it too elaborate for some ...  
I don't trust the critics, i see, do and feel for myself ...

everything evolving to kill humans is the biggest bs ever. Its like we evolving just to kill aliens or something like that. It wasn't neccesary for animals to evolve this trait because its not like the ones that didn't know how to kill humans would die. Unless all the animals that couldn't kill humans died then that means they still have their genes being passed on more likely they would evolve to not rely so much on humans. Animals like rats and cockroaches would have to evolve back to being able to sustain themselves off of natural foods as they couldn't raid kitchen cuboards anymore.

Why are there so many negative comments, but yet the dislike bar is almost non-existent? was it worth watching?

wena peli

This is the Best Movie I ever watched :))))

previews were way better than the movie

I can`t believe this movie is that bad. I have to see it!

Idk but I actually liked this movie

Lets just get real, who agrees if Jaden Smith sucks at acting?

It takes a while to get used to the movie plot being set a thousand years into the future, but all you really care about beyond that, is better alive than never.

I get why some people struggle to really like this movie, but it does introduce several very interesting and original concepts. If you are thinking about watching this movie but not sure if you will like it, watching it in full HD is honestly quite breathtaking.

That Fears  are not real ..

Those movies where the trailer is better that the movie.

people are stupid,...movie is amazing, just because one said it's bad herd repeat straigh away. useless modern humanity...

I'm only here because of the We Hate Movie podcast, I thought they were joking but they were right.

boring

I still cant believe how bad this movie was i thought it was going to be good

The only true talent that you will find in this movie it's Isabelle Fuhrman. Such a shame (or relief, maybe?) that it's a small appearance.

it feels like im the only one who actually liked the movie...hmmm shows how people are different. I bet some of yall are just following the crowd and sayin its awful.

booooooring.

I think this movie will be equâl to the maze runner if it is than i will watch

Como La Busco Cunpleta nO La Encuentro

The trailer for this movie is really good.  But the movie isn't lol

Worst movie in history
0/10

what a expected disappointment.....i will never pay to see this clown and his little brat in amovie again

Trailer better than the movie.

Well done to the Smith family. Refreshing to see a strong, manly Black father figure who cares for his family. They both stay alive to the end WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN TACT and learn character building skills such as conquering fears and venturing into the unknown. Fear is required to keep caucasians in charge of the World and so this narrative must be belittled to smash the confidence of those who dare not uphold the status quo. Of course aforementioned will be denied within the western World and examples of how rubbish the film is, will be repeated until a sizeable relevant number agree. Smiths, I look forward to more futuristic films where Black Peoples survive, flourish and have happy healthy lives.  I enjoyed seeing the real father and son act as thus in another film. Thank you.

After Earth?  More like After Birth.

Como se llama esa película en español..??

I guess it is possible for Will Smith's son to star in a bad movie even when his father is also in the movie. "After Earth" exists to remind people that M. Night Shymalan has still only made two good movies and those movies are "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This could possibly be his worst film to date. The concept and the story for "After Earth" could have worked if it was executed properly. At least this film gave people the opportunity to watch Doug Walker review it.

This movie is good in concept, but it's painful to watch in execution, due to the fact that this kid doesn't know how to act worth shit.  He never gets into character (I don't think he even bothered reading the script) and you can tell he's obviously being coached from scene to scene on how he should be reacting to everything, that's why his emotional responses to different situations just never quite match what's going on around him.  There's a cringe-worthy moment when Will Smith hands him over the marathon race baton like "Here son, it's time to cash in on hype, and your turn to torture audiences with your shitty non-acting like I did for many decades!".

mac je ovaj mali jaden

I actually had hype for this film. Then, when I watched it, it was so boring and un-interesting that I fell asleep to it like 2 to 3 times.

The mass thinking in the comment section is hilarious. I like this movie. Could be better but I still like it since at that time I had my own father and son troubles so I can relate. And how emotions sometimes need to be repressed in a hostile environment like society so you won't get consumed by them. That's what I understood from this movie and other themes. The directors and the actors didn't like it either? So what. It's still their opinion I'm not gonna say oh I don't like it even the actors said they don't so that gives me better argument. Opinion is opinion. A lot of these people in the comments are also very rude to people who like this movie and unappreciative that filmmakers and actors make movies for them to watch.

Stupidest movie i have ever watched

I honestly didn't think this movie was THAT bad.

I always wondered what the song in this trailer was?

Truly terrible movie

i think Jayden has potential and is gonna become a good actor but he shouldn't play with his father in the same movie. Thats the only problem.

a movie that flopped so hard it made the earth Crack

Thank god I did not pay money to see this. INTERNET PIRACY FTW!!!!!

Personally i do not think it was that bad. I would have given it 3 stars, 6 on 1-10, not 2 stars or a 4. I kind of enjoyed it seeing it for the first time and i am quite blasé..

My whatsapp Brazil just me call +55 119499575163

il the movie its awesome but will smith should let his kid be his kid ,..... I??????????????????????Jb .. Nah jk

some cheesy looking CGI

I like it too

Magic is real?
WOW! I DID NOT KNOW THAT!

somebody knows what is the name the soundtrack of this trailer

Shittiest movie this decade.

This film was directed by  M. Night Shyamalan. That's the twist.

Good movie ?

I am legend - a movie starring only will smith.
After earth - a movie starring only will smith and his son.

ego alert!

2/10

snoozed when this came on tv

movie was ok

i loved this movie....people are tearing it down because its of a black man and his son..white america hates seeing that

This movie flopped big time, I mean it came and went and nobody saw it ha-ha. 

i regret watching this movie,wasted my time... the kid actor is really bad on Acting, needs lot of workshop. Wish Will Smith didn't let his son do this project.. and wish Will Smith do it, I guess it will be better...

this is crap

what's up with the accents?!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This trailer was on point though

My god have you people gotten to a new low! So many of you are praising a movie that has terrible writing, awful acting, big plot holes, and most of the typical bullshit clichés Shamaladingdong loves to put in his films. The only 2 good things about this film are the visuals and that there's THANKFULLY no plot twist in the film (as far as I'm concerned). Other than that, this movie is horrible. Hell, even Will Smith himself felt terrible for making this movie.

the trailer was way better then the movie" says my dad. "yeah it is" I say back. *in my mind* "that was a good movie"

I havn't seen the film, but the high-speech in this trailer is wrong in my opinion. Fear is an emotion, and probably the only things we can be sure about are our emotions. Fear is a natural reaction to a danger that might or might not be real. Discrediting emotions just because of their nature is wrong. I don't know if this idea is resolved in the film, but i doubt it. By all means being able to overcome fear when necessary, is virtue. But conditioning people to fear not being real, is irresponsible. What do you think?

This movie is the current work leadership culture. Like Idols and Weakest Link, customer service fields. Everything is against thinking and feeling, and for fear and authority. The plot makes no sense, because it is just the context for putting people against maximum abuse, and feeling intrigued how much they can take. I thought Smith was smarter than this.

I actually liked this movie, Will Smith as I've never seen him. Very entertaining

who else cried when the eagle died? :(

i cant believe people actually enjoy this film.

what's with all the fuss? this movie wasn't so bad.

I just got it today and I have not seen it yet

6/10
Good idea, not so good implementation.

The only thing wrong with this movie
Is the amount of time animals
Have evolved
It should not be 1000 years
It should be 1,5mil years ago

All I remember about seeing this movie in theaters was that I was the 5th wheel.

Jaden was awesome in this movie.

Next time the earth will face a big disaster we may not survive, *because people always start to fight instead of working together*, and now that we have nuclear weapons etc. it will do way more damage.

I see no other option but the truth. It´s the only thing everyone has in common, *the only thing that can unite religions and people.* Check out the truthcontest website

The movie was meh, but this trailer is genius. 

This movie was horrible. ..

good trailer...boring movie...non sense movie..bad acting,bad story line , good effects, bad ending..bad movie...worst than ive thought

Like Father like Son, haha.

No, but in all serious is was not all that bad. People seem to be judging the way Jaden Smith acts by the way his father does. His father has been in this business way longer than his son. And what better way make sure Jaden is successful in life, than throwing him in a movie and making a shit ton of money off of it?
But in actual, real seriousness, I liked the movie. Whoever doesn't needs to lighten up and just enjoy it.

Man, the potential this movie had. It could have been so good!!!!!

Oh shit, just noticed they didn't mention M.Night. I wonder why

This movie made me fell asleep. It was so fuckin boring

Boring movie ?

You all can kiss Will Smith and Jayden's rear. I have watched "all" of their movies and this one I have to say is the best! I just watched this movie and loved it to death! I dismissed it all this time cause idiots like you all have the movie a bad rep. I just watch it out of the blue to see for myself. I knew Will Smith was a smart actor and he does his research well. He will not do something that he thought would fail. And, with that on mind I sought out to watch the movie. I'm glad I did and it was outstanding! I loved it better than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Never cared for those except for The original Star Wars movie. Negroes should have came out in droves to support this movie. In my opinion it deserves an oscar.

i love the trailer music. it helped give such a great impression. still one of the best trailers in the last few years for a movie that turned out to be terrible. such a lost opportunity. trailer made it look brilliant

great movie, great acting, great director. 
hate me if you want. idgaf

Miidy Sama I do not agree with you. I thought Will & his son did a great job.  They are awesome together.

How are they ganna repopulate the earth?

What in the hell is this movie about anyway?

Is this another corporate attempt to make people scared of wild animals and therefore make people not engage in conservation work?

Worst movie EVER!! (comic book guy voice)

Those nigga´s are finished. xD

My boyfriend hates m night shyamalan movies, I freaking LOVE them!  The sixth sense was a classic. Watched it just Kay night!  And the lady in the water/lake I have to watch again. The village was great. The avatar was good but not my favorite because of the misuse words of names. I think it's a copyright issue, but this.....this movie, after earth was THE SECOND BEST OF THEM ALL. I have say sixth Sence is my top favorite. 
His stories and ideas are Amazing!  You go NIGHT! The next movie you make I'm sure going to see it! 

That kid is a horrible actor.

if you don't want to loose your time, you will skip this movie.

Will, please stop doing movies like this and just do another franchise of men in black

Just finished watching this moments ago. What a shitty movie. I've wasted almost 2 hrs of my life on this. Idk if it's trying to tell something, like maybe moral values or about bravery or whatever. Okay, but the plot is a mess. Nonsense 

This movie was bad....just...bad. Not even entertaining bad either...just all round bad like if we were back in the times where we rented out DVD's I would actually burn this DVD to prevent others from experiencing the suckiness that is Jayden Smith.

this movie had so much potential but unfortunately that wasn't the case :(

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?

Where i can buy this music?

wats this movie bout? 

this is quite possibly a masterpiece

I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the "grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green Lantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes were sour. It's a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. 
I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

I think some people can't handle the run time, identify with the subtext or characters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and violent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to feel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of people from achieving any success or prestige.
I don't give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from enjoying my life and taking an interest in new things

This movie is awesome what are you people saying!!

This is how we feel when we have to watch movies like Alexander and the very bad day when all of the cast is white people [boring]. This is boring because half of the cast is black right?

I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have found someone better because the story seems solid.

I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. When I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why people were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda trolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible because they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were expecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a family drama that happens to be set in the future.   

This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen classic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent critics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the reviews kept me away when it came out.

 It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented environmental statements and a really important statement about handling fear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no qualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious wanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar sites.

I just got this movie on blueray DVD for my birthday and love it. It's a great movie ?  ?????+

Jaden Smith should get a razzie for the worst actor of all time and M knight shamalamadingdong should get a razzie for worst director of all time

I enjoyed this movie for the first time, but now the movie was actually just a bad movie.

This movie looked so cool! I wanted to watch it, i never did though. :(
I don't know why people say it's suckish movie, it seems cool. People just need to stop being assholes.

m. night shyamalan is the worst screenwriter ever. for real. ive watched the last airbender too and the series is the best. but his movie.. was the worst! will smith is the best actor but this movie is the worst too.

Does anyone know the name of the song?

Will Smith Jaden can't act! Try to find smth else he is talented at.. seriously...

trailer is better than the movie :)

this could've been "something"... I was honestly expecting more from Shaymalan, what happened to his career? bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. god i hate this movie so much dont watch it. dont waste your time.

/.  .\
  L 
  .     how can mirrors be real?

I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a complete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!

I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all filler shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love will smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate kid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I expected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed 

I liked this movie 

Fakka you Jonhson

Gives me chills every time

One thing I did like was the quote about FEAR 

I clicked on this trailer .."ironically"...
:D

I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen kindergarten plays with better acting abilities.

I watched this entire film. I followed Jaden Smith on his Twitter-Account. And now, i´m going to kill myself.

I give it a 6. Because of the negative thoughts you all have towards the actors that's why you all couldn't enjoy the movie

One of the best movies ever made in our times ! J/K it sucked -_-

*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had got basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, it would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the hand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much hatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would have been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, and if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have made the story much better.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that seemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it comes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that some colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between these two due to the color of their skin. 

I'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to life on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together which flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one person focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and wishing the Smiths many more movies together.

Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them like twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.

Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!

this was an amazing movie. 

i hurt this movie you can do a lot better then that will
 

the trailer is still awesome, such a shame the movie was abysmal

Some stuff I didn't know until just now, thought I'd share:

"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted to work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn't find a suitable project. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer Will Smith was responsible for much of the movie's direction. While M. Night Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of shots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color and design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his performance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen action."

this is ass

Everything wrong with this movie.

1. The background story is GARBAGE. So WIll hurts his son's feelings and makes it up to him by bringing him along on a space mission like it's bring your kid to work day.
2. They have al this advanced technology and the only weapon anyone ever uses is spears like it's the medieval times.
3. If Earth is so unsuitable for life why are there plants and trees growing everywhere, why is is so GREEN? Seems pretty suitable for me.
4. Will Smith is about as interesting as a rock. He has no emotion at all.
5. Jaden Smith is a terrible actor.
6. Some creature at one point obviously tries to kill him but then minutes later it saves his life. Why? Who knows.
7. The earth part was BORING!

Such a bad movie but such a cool trailer 

Shit movie with decent effects

What's the name of the music?

Filming me while taking multiple shits would have made a tremendously better movie.

After Earth was a damn good movie.  As far as sci-fi and futuristic movies go, this is one of the best Ive seen.  The acting was superb!  I know because I teared up a few times.  

I just cant imagine why it got such poor reviews.?

I really wish celebrity parents would let their kids get a taste of the real world, instead of building their entire life for them.  The truth is, by not allowing them to endure and overcome at least some of life's challenges, they're doing they're kids a real disservice.  These kids have almost no choice but to develop a completely deluded perspective on the world.

Sidebar:  I haven't seen this movie, 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happyness - Are any of those worth seeing?  So far, I've never seen Will Smith play a serious role that I enjoyed.

I still didnt get why humans with advanced technology still use spears to battle animal like aliens. did weapons technology downgrade to medieval era while everything else advanced into the space age?? wtf?

M. Night Shyamalan directed this movie, that is why people are saying it sucks.

He's the guy who made Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Happening.

The acting by Jaden Smith is exactly how I picture him in real life. An arrogant I do what I want attitude 

Worst movie of all time. Nothing more to be said

This was an awesome movie I don't know why people talking sh*t about it

Fear is no more a choice than any other emotion.

hej jaden smith kol film

To be honest I actually liked this movie. I can find myself wanting to watch it over and over again on Starz.

boring as shit 

that movie sucked

Anybody know the music used the trailer?

Super

Someone needs to tell that kid to get of his high horse....little jackass...

Jaden smith did a lot better in "the pursuit of happiness" :/

I heard will smith has a son... Where is he..??? Genetics skipped a generation I guess. 

i liked this movie, dont understand why will smith sees it as a painfull failure..........

will smith said this was the worst movie he has ever done

This is everyday in Australia

Can I get a plot or story element with this trailer please? How do you expect anybody to be interested in a trailer that shows nothing but two guys looking lost for 2 minutes?

Who cares if he hired his son??????? It's a great movie. Better than a lot of crappy movies that have success in the box office.

This was a good movie, dont listen to the white critics, Its hard to find a good black family movie that everyone can watch, sci fi to top it off. Meanwhile Bo Jack Horseman sucks an matthew perry keeps getting sorry ass tv shows. I could name 50 movies that After Earth was better than. I want a sequel, but I know it wont happen because of the big star of will smith. Any body who disputes me but calls Sharknado amazing shows their true colors, an as we all know sharknado was a hit a terrible hit.

I don't think Jaden Smith is cut out to be an actor. He fit the roll of cute kid in Pursuit of Happyness pretty well but he was pretty mediocre in this. Plot was horrid too.

Will Smith has to understand that his kid is not Will Smith. 

Such a great film 

i heard it was good

Very good movie ??

This movie has good CGI effects, and that's about all it has to offer. Half of the movie is on a ship and super-boring, and the Earth part isn't much better, nothing really happens. Would've been pissed if I went to a theater and wasted money. It's a shame such a good concept was wasted on this monstrosity.

Well  folks  is a nice  movie  stop  hating 

Funny thing about all these people commenting shit about this movie and yet Will smith probably made more money on this movie alone than they will make in 2 life times

So I'm not the only one who thought Will Smith was the main actor?

Leave it to M. night shayamalean to give Will Smith his first box office bomb in decades.

Whats song? =( tellme please!!!

stupid movie i don't want to watch it

Mr Will Smith sir, please stop shoving Smith Jr. in our faces and let him do something he is good at.
Thanks for wasting royalties on a garbage movie.

Will smith sacrificing his son 

This movie is one of the worse will smith movies, I have seen in my LIFE. I love Will Smith and I think it is so cute that he wants a movie with his son. but the movie is boring, the CGI stinks, and the acting sucks! The concept made no sense  and I never finished the entire movie. 

This movie was terrible. I love Will Smith, but his career took a hit with this.

I really liked the movie, the story line was great, a lot of message. And then Jaden had to go through a lot in order to survive

my uncle johnny can act better than will smith's son in this movie, and he's been dead for three years!

BEST MOVIE EVER !! 

Can somebody please find me the music used in this trailer ?

Just wanted to see the movie when i read this comment : Ein wirklich selten langweiliger Film, mit einfach nur schlechten Schauspielern.Insbesondere Will Smith Sohn, der den ganzen Film lang immer nur einen einzigen stets dummen Gesichtsausdruck hat. Ich befürchte der Junge ist geistig behindert. XD

looks like before earth to me.

I know it got terrible reviews, but watching this trailer really makes me want to see the film. Can it really be that shitty?

Can someone tell me why the reviews for this movie are so awful? Haha, I didn't think it was anything special but I didn't find it god awful like everybody says it was.

I was like"14 million views for the trailer of after earth what the hell?" but then i watched it.

Worst piece of shit Smith has done for a while, and that's saying something. 

one of the worse movies ever made

I dont care what people think, I love this movie. It was original. So many movies in Hollywood are sequels, one dimensional, same plot, no diversity and have laugh tracks. I guarantee you if a white person fell asleep watching Gone with the Wind and just happen to wake up and saw this movie, well,you can fill in the blank. If they woke up and saw a Tyler Perry movie, they never would of know they were 75 years in the future. I promote diversity in over 100 of my videos. What got me started was how African Americans are always underrepresented or looking buffoonish in Hollywood movies. I just hate that image. As a SAG actor, I am just telling my version of the story, god knows, we already know the other version.

I'M NOT A CAWROT! YO THE CAWROT.... I'M NOT A CAWROT!!!

Why is my suit turning black? I LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING BAD. 

best line from jaden who smith. 

there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the trailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on earth anymore? just a logic

I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still a kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? 
I mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his puberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!
He just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?
