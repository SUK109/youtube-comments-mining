awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.


check this
Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.
Watch at
iwantmovies.info

it was not awesome IT WAS EPIC!!!!


I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Watch cool new movies only at Viooz and u can aslo watch planes

hd awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

greatttttttttttttttttttttttttt for                   ice age                known dddddddddddddjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

Love This Movie!

The song is called. What if the storm ends by snow patrol.

Whats the song called in this trailer

I have to watch that.Thats cool

I need sequel, i want to see ronin again 3

this movie had a John Carter of Mars kinda vibe. I highly recommend that one to people who enjoyed this.

/watch?v=0hQpAlAN_sg&feature=c4-overview&list=UUJMktBfTrzcRT28wzbpDEYw

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

I feel your pain...

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

/watch?v=0hQpAlAN_sg&feature=c4-overview&list=UUJMktBfTrzcRT28wzbpDEYw

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.


check this
Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

it was not awesome IT WAS EPIC!!!!


I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Watch cool new movies only at Viooz and u can aslo watch planes

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

http://hemosvisto.blogspot.com/2013/10/epic-el-mundo-secreto.html

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Hemos Visto
http://hemosvisto.blogspot.com/2013/10/epic-el-mundo-secreto.html

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I liked it ????

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Hemos Visto
http://hemosvisto.blogspot.com/2013/10/epic-el-mundo-secreto.html

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Easy way to make money from home! and it Works 100%

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Hemos Visto
http://hemosvisto.blogspot.com/2013/10/epic-el-mundo-secreto.html

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

I dont get it.Are they out of ideas? Everywhere the funny guy is a SNAIL!!!!!!!! At this movie they are 2 snails.Mab and Grab.At Turbo a snail is the primary character.Monsters University is a snail.snail snail snail.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I feel your pain...

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

/watch?v=0hQpAlAN_sg&feature=c4-overview&list=UUJMktBfTrzcRT28wzbpDEYw

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

no, avatar is more like a metaphor of white people raping american indian and their land..

What If This Storm Ends? - Snow Patrol

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

awsome

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.


check this
Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It was epic!!!*

It is god

the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

http://hemosvisto.blogspot.com/2013/10/epic-el-mundo-secreto.html

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Trailer was amazing got hooked up but when I saw the Movie i was disappointed but it was still good  

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

I dont get it.Are they out of ideas? Everywhere the funny guy is a SNAIL!!!!!!!! At this movie they are 2 snails.Mab and Grab.At Turbo a snail is the primary character.Monsters University is a snail.snail snail snail.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I feel your pain...

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :).

/watch?v=0hQpAlAN_sg&feature=c4-overview&list=UUJMktBfTrzcRT28wzbpDEYw

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.


check this
Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Watch cool new movies only at Viooz and u can aslo watch planes

Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

This movie is called epic and this movie is epic n funniest the best I was so into it it's watchable too. The best movie ever(y) :)

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Do you like Pixar? Then please visit my channel. I need your support! /watch?v=sQ0UN3BW9L0?

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

booooringgg

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - The Lightning Strike

I dont get it.Are they out of ideas? Everywhere the funny guy is a SNAIL!!!!!!!! At this movie they are 2 snails.Mab and Grab.At Turbo a snail is the primary character.Monsters University is a snail.snail snail snail.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I feel your pain...

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.


check this
Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Watch cool new movies only at Viooz and u can aslo watch planes

It was epic!!!*

It is god

the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

THAT SONG! i know it <3

I liked it ????



Trailer was better than the freaking movie. 

* they'll try

Hey at least Blue Sky looks like they tried.

why does it say on netflix that it has a rating of 14A, does it really ??

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike ?

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

I love you

I love you

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What if the storm ends -Snow Patrol.   Incase anyone is wondering what the song is called. -You're welcome.

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

every 100 years queen tara gives power to a special flower pod to choose an heir so the forest will continue as the life of the forest. the pod must bloom in the light of the moon in between moonhaven and summer solstice. if the pod blooms in darkness the forest will die.

Is it? No, it couldn't be. Or is it? Is that seriously an Institute song playing? If so I'm seeing this movie for that reason alone.

i like this movie

this moVIE WAS SO GOOD. HOLY FRICKIN SHIT. 

I LOVED IT! WORTH WATCHING THIS MOVIE.... :D

good but illuminatic

this is really one of my fav. animated movie of 2013 : )

epic hahaha 

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found. They have all of the most recent movies on the net so you can sit back and watch them easily and safely so long as you have a web connection. Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

whats the song :)?

Great movie but I was honestly expecting something different

if you guys want to watch the movie without any conditions click on this link: http://www.movie4k.to/Epic-watch-movie-3828090.html
just click on the button that says "close ad and continue as free user" then the "start video" button and ignore the pop ups and your good to go. Enjoy.

This movie was actually quite good, not nearly as boring or predictable as so many people claim it to be.

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

I dont get it.Are they out of ideas? Everywhere the funny guy is a SNAIL!!!!!!!! At this movie they are 2 snails.Mab and Grab.At Turbo a snail is the primary character.Monsters University is a snail.snail snail snail.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I feel your pain...

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

snow patrol / the lightning strike 

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :).

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

What's the song called

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

Watch cool new movies only at Viooz and u can aslo watch planes

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

BEST MOVIE EVER

whats this song?

Who else came here just for the awesome music?! XD

first impression about falling bird with something on back, is that thing one of Doraemon thing to control and ride animal? and then they discover small people living in forest and anything like that. Coincidence? well, i dont know... :p

I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv those both!?

The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over again.

what song is this?

I had no idea this would turn out to be such a good movie.

Was this a good movie? Worth watching?

Good Film Made By one of the best animation studios out there tbh Blue Sky Studios

The Best animated trailer i've ever seen...
beutifull music...

How can it be, the fandom for this movie is nearly not existing... it's so great there should be much more fan-made stuff to celebrate it!

Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...

the guy Nod kind of remind me alot of the guy played edward cullen lol his look 

the name should be changed to lame

This wasn't really EPIC. but It was fine.

I totally loved M.Ks Outfit in that movie, so I´ve uploaded a video on how to style like her! OOTD | How to style like M.K. (Mary Katherine) from Epic | Ladylike

What s this song called

Anything that will help the future of society to protect nature im all for. Thats why i loved a bugz life

Kara - Step cover

Epic trailer, not quite an Epic movie.

Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, they're getting there.  

i think frozen is better

What is the name of the song thats playing?

this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really good overall!

Una gran película que aprovecha el tirón #Avatar. Nos gustó, aunque podía haber sido algo mejor.

Crativo - Forget HD (Feat RomyHarmony)

For a non disney-pixar studio it did pretty good in the box office so we could be seeing a sequel.

 Beautiful movie. Loved the characters they were really down to earth. Not everyone will like it though since it goes beyond the traditional Pixar-Disney movies we seen of late.

The graphics for this movie is beyond amazing!

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

This movie rocks! I seen it on this new website I discovered where you can actually look at many of the best movies for free online - without the need for downloading anything to your PC. I was surprised how convenient it was to safely view movies for free. Below is the website link if you just want to check it out your self. *WatchTheseNow. ???*

This trailer is cool, I'm guessing, but if you want to watch the complete movie, you must see this website I recently found.

Just go to this web site to try it for yourself . *WatchTheseNow. ???*

Dude you've gotta tell me what this song is called and from whom. Doesn't sound like Pitbull thank God.  

The My Little Pony version is waaaaay better. ^_^

Looks like Arthur and the minimoys  a bit o_O

This is made for trippers. Come on...

Genial movie!. Muy graciosa y la animación es excelente.

I saw it at 
aspmoviesite.azurewebsites. net/movies/watch/Epic_2013

(remove spaces)
Damn it's awesome - not rly anime though - still good!

snow patrol - the lightning strike

whats the song?

It might be that but when you say anime, or even google that shit you come up with japanese cartoons period. It's widely accepted that ANIME is what i just said.

You can just as easily debate that Cancer is a constellation and not just a disease. But what is it mostly attributed to?

No one calls these types of movies Anime.

This movie was given to me for my 5 yr old...in my opinion it is not appropriate for kids. As soon as I saw that Beyonce had a part in it and the Queen, I knew to be cautious of the content. Then I saw this. The music itself is not for small children. I still haven't watched the movie nor did I let her watch it. Just my opinion.

This is what I got: Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. 

Tomas

Whoa... thanks lol. 

(???)

? ?????? ?????
? ???????????????
? ???????????????

mee too


YIFY got me here :P

anime has a somewhat nominal definition that is, although it is "animation", does not necessarily include all animations. hence, the segregation from the general genre "animation"

anime is the "television" version of a manga (japanese comic) so its diferent

joe it is ?

what song is this?


Google Anime and tell me what you come up with lol. 

I would just like to point out that "Anime" is shortened from the word "Animation" or "Animated".

every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free

de puta madre


hellwoo!

WTF the guy jumping and falling sounded like link

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for.

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D

Snow Patrol - What If the Storm Ends

funny they make a movie about green vs swarm when both were the substance of forest and nature. 
all plant, animal, insects and fish no.1 enemy is us human being. i hope they make a movie about how human destroy the life of everything out there and teach our kids the truth.

Snow Patrol - What If The Storm Ends?

I've seen this movie. Audio is great, both fx and soundtrack. Story well written, reminds me of old Disney movies and progression of the story is as you expect. The best part of this movie is jokes and references to other movies, it's what drives the movie. This is worth watching and paying for. 

lynn

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

im excited with this movie. there is Josh Hutcherson's voice as Nod aww 

Glad to see, that "Ice Age" creators could create something really good at last.

This movie is a new version of Fergully.

In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

Snow Patrol - What if the storm ends ?


What song is that?

Hhahahaa I'm downloading this movie and gonna watch it soon lol =D

one of my favorite animation movie <3 !! 

What i mean is it's not Anime.  Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation. You are confusing animation with Anime. 

oic thx this is the best animation movie in 2013 :)

anime is a Japanese style bro not animation :). 

wat u mean its not anime?

Except it's not anime...

the best anime movie in 2013 :)

just watched this amazing animation work by Blue Sky, earlier today.

unlike Dethpunk, I thought  the characters were hilarious, endearing and brilliantly depicted.

of course, this film is not exactly "weirdo noir" for the heavy metal goth crowd.

in fact, a lot of kids might, actually, find it fabulous.

Fonik - Minecraft Dubstep Song
pls its epic

So so so good ... !!!


Watched a day ago. As a 3D animator I am impressed by the animation works did here. The scenes are beautifully rendered. Camera works are nice too.

However, as a movie-goer, I say this movie sucks. This is not epic, its FUCKING LAME and filled with insufferable annoying characters I have ever watched since Meet the Robinsons. I find Professor Bomba (the dad), Nim Galuu (a hyper annoying glowworm) and Mub and Grub (a pair retarded snail and slug) to be some of the lamest characters in 3D history

true story my friend!

epic


Fern Gully in 3D!

Love this film.

This movie was epic!

Snow Patrol - The lightning strike

What name of this song?

A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world -- and ours.

I really love this movie, but they kind of copied Arthur and the Invisibles. Other than that, it was pretty funny and great :)

The fact that Beyoncé participates in this movie >>>>

Whatd this song called??

Thanks, i'll give it a shot.

yes!!!!

yes! Its sweet!

Is it worth watching?

What for a song is this ?

Underrated movie, or overrated expectations? I usually hear people talk about how great a movie was, but I didn't hear anyone talk about this at all.

It's not that epic. And i hate the ending.

It was a pretty decent movie tbh. Worth a watch :)

It was epic!!!*

It is god

they changed mk hair


the music is so good

The movie was good, but some of the characters' voices were miscast.  I like most of the actors and singers as individuals, but just not for this movie.

Best Movie <3 <3 <3

Welcome to youtube. Enjoy your stay.

finally a good trailer, with an awesome music and without spoilers

I'm not sure its the little things sometimes that make or break a film maybe the snails could have been funnier or something to tell you the truth I don't know but I really enjoyed the movie personally

I saw this video on Amazon!

Steven Tyler is Nim Galluu...

Awesome.

the one who says this? That would be a weeaboo :P :D

I saw a few scenes at Walmart! Gotta see this movie...

SCARY!

This cartoon is awsome!!! J cant beleve there is 803 dislikes...J mean why?Who r you people?:D

alright hahaah u convinced me

Animation is really fun to watch. A great idea I have for Disney I have is a well-developed animated feature in 2-D/3-D as well as Paperman except in color and in full length. I think it should also be about a professional ballerina princess whom would dance in very lovely inspiring ways. I'm really fond of ballet that I draw ballet dancers all the time.

I LOVED IT! :D

Beyonce!!!!

yep it sucked shit, saw it on an airplane. First time i use an airsickness bag though! Thanks for that at least

go to my channel to watch Epic full movie....thank me later...=)

World beyond our imagination? That would be the anime world :P :D
