Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment.

Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS.

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment.

So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period...

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period...

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh".

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack.

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest.

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be !

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh".

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh".

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

Star wars is better. The views say it all.

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2?

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Will there be another Star Trek movie coming out soon?

Lol it's syler 

Idc what people say I'm a primal series fan but I also love what J J did withy these films it's a chance for a new generation 

cbs and paramount ruined this franchise... need more original story telling of star trek, come back jj

I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but these two movies were surprisingly better than the average joes you get nowadays.

Star Trek is about our possible future utopia, its about what humanity can possibly become. Star Wars is just action adventure fun but i would not want to live in that universe, unless im a jedi of course 

Benedict voice is amazing!!

I'm Star wars fan in General
But this is my favorite star trek movie......
The new Star Trek films 09 and 13 approaches non- sci fi fans.....
Bravo JJ Abrhams

Isn't Star Wars and Star Trek pretty much the same thing?

it seems on mass effect.Khan is a Saren,Spock is a Garrus.

star wars is for kids and star trek is for adults.

The best Star Trek movie so far.

"My name is KHAN!" ....from the epiglottis :) 

Best star trek films:

1/ Star trek 2009
2/ First contact
3/ Wrath of Khan
4/ Into darkness

I'm making my own movies with these animations at this movie with action movie fx app 
Link:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8

Great movie in my opinion for my generation

I had headache watching this movie. Seems like no one knows how to avoid camera flare, and everybody only knows how to record camera flare. BAD MOVIE MAKING. Terrible distraction form storyline enjoyment. 

Benedict as a villian.holy mollly i m gonnna watch this ??????

comparing this trier with star wars trailer hmm..

hhmmm just good

very crap star trek movie!!

I know Pine don't want imitate Shatner, but at least imitate KIRK ! He may look like a young Shatner , but His acting range and they way they write His lines are awful . Look at the  way He goes to Khan and says " I will end You ! ", for one that even a old saying here in the 21st century but the way He stresses it would make me laugh if He said that to me , but its not a sentence Kirk would ever say. Im glad that Writer is off the film. So far they made these Actors cardboard cut-outs of the original players instead of playing them as they are Suppose to Be ! I have this film and rarely watch it . People are hyped for Star Wars , wait till they se what Abram's will do to that series and ruin it like Star Trek . I hope Star Trek Beyond coming out next summer is very good if not Paramount will dump this series.

I love this franchise wayyy to much. I mean Spock and Nyota?! ? Chris Pine. ZACHARY QUINTO Zoe Saldana. And, HELL YEAH, Benedict Cumberbatch.

I watched this film only to see Benedict. enjoyed it quite a bit though

I'm not going to spoil anything but remember start trek the voyage home, I think that the new star trek movies ruined the past like... I'll say this short and simple, since the new time line in the first new star trek movie, what if kirk and his ship aren't out in space when the probe hits in the 6th movie, what if because of the new time line they are on earth and screwed?

this is one of the best star trek movies I have ever seen !!!!! AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!!

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

i came here bc of benedict cumberbatch

Well hello there, Chris Pine. Well HELLOOOOO there Benedict Cumberbatch!

At first I didn't realise why most of the Star Trek fans weren't fawning over the new movies, but instead hating them. I've seen the old ones and I kinda got why some fans hated the new movies, but I mean, come on. 

And then I realised that it was the same for me and the new The Hobbit movies. God, I hate them. Sure, I can see why people like them, but seriously. I. Hate. Them. They do /not/ bring The Hobbit justice.

So now I understand if/why fans hate the new Star Trek movies. c:

One of my epic collection. Best ever.

here only for Benedict Cumberbatch..

i think jj abrams did a great job

I would like to see an evil Q continuum where they try to take over the galaxy or universe!!!  Kind of like the book by Christopher Nuttal, Storming Heaven!!  Wonderful plot to a movie or TV series!!!

i like the white aliens in the starting

The movie was o.k, but the acting was god-awful

is this a good time to be mentioning the greatest song of all creation?

"star trekking across the universe..."

I feel like this film is completely underrated. I loved it.

yup always have to turn everything into an action movie 

I remember how cool, this trailer looked in high school. I used to watch it in between classes. It's unfortunate the movie didn't live up to it. Not that it wasn't great, this trailer made it look like it would be in the spirit of the The Dark Knight....

SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Both movies had great special effects but the Enterprise had too much white, especially the bridge. Of course if you paint everything the same color it does cut down on production costs. The acting was fair to good. Neither movie developed the chemistry feel between the characters like TOS, TNG, and DS9 did. They used the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch brewing facility for the Enterprise engineering scenes in ST 2009 and the National Ignition Facility of Lawrence Livermore Labs for engineering in ST Into Darkness. I didn't care much for their choice of engineering in both movies. I would rather have seen a better engineering dept. than all the glitter and flash of the bridge. I also didn't care much for the ship phasers. Didn't seem very powerful compared to ST TOS. Don't even get me started on Treks version of Jar Jar Binks(Scotty's little alien friend) and the hats used in both movies. The ones in ST Into Darkness reminded me a lot of the ones used in Star Wars. I can kind of understand the ball cap that Archer wore in Enterprise since it was the 22nd century, a tv series and only 100 years after 21st century Earth.  Caps and hats in the 23rd century? Entirely unnecessary. I remember the episode of Farpoint on TNG when Picard told Q about that Marine Corps uniform and how they had grown out of wearing something like that. What does JJ do? He makes his version of that Marine uniform and those ridiculous hats and caps.

Expecting a trailer like this for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Here you are, Sherlock. in a spaceship

I literally squealed like crazy every time I heard or saw Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so hot in this movie!

im bored of all his trailers and i dont wanna talk about the movie cuz i watched it omg STAR WARS IS GONE PEOPLE BOLIVE ME HE WILL DESTROY IT

I HATE YOU JJ ABRAMS

There are those who say this is the worst Star Trek movie ever made. Those people clearly have selective memories.

after watching this movie and latter sherlock,i needed about 8 month to realise that Benedict Cumberbatch its in start trek ,and it was pure confidence.... sorry for poss bad eng

Do i have to watch other star treks to know whats goin on in this one?

Old-school Star Trek:Boost the shields so we can release the high power of the cannons toward the left dock.

Modern Stark Trek:FIRE EVERYTHING!!!

Yeah this movie is realy bad

Saldana is such a nuisance in that movie.. unbelievable.

this must be the lamest cast ever. I m not into star trek but these actors make me slash my wrist :/   bad chemistry

Meh, I think a darker-skinned actor could have been used for Khan. Oh well, at least we got Cumberbatch!

KAHN!

Please, NO BORGS IN STAR TREK 3!!!!!!! The Borg thing was weird and should be left in the 90's where it came from (I think). I like to see aliens instead of Borgs. Thank you. :)

Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's chemistry in this is waht didi it for me. I LOVED how Spock irritated Jim's  in this. It was funny to see both sides of their opinion on matters. Plus Chris Pine is Key-yute! Couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!

I can tell there going to milk this dry, so as long as they are they should do it right and bring back John de Lancie's Q 

Wow! Chris(kirk) and Zach(spock) are so very adorable there!I'm already watch the movie!
And when christopher pike dead,,the sound effect was make someone want to cry...
And also when Kirk is dead,,,When saw zach face cry,,just make me want cry too...  :')

To be honest I like watching the trailer more than the movie itself 

Everyone is talking Star Trek and all that and I dint understand any of it... I'm not a Star Trek or Star Wars fan.

Benedict Cumberbatch is so hot right now!

Chris pine is everything 

Didn't watch this movie but I kinda prefer the 1st movies over the rest 

Guardians of the galaxy? 

CHRIS PINE IS KIRK. TOTALLY AWESOME.. CHRIS YOU  NEED TO KEEP DOING THIS PART UNTIL  I DIE. ITS MY DRUG OF CHOICE. IM 67 AND YOU FIT THIS LIKE A GLOVE. GET JJ TO DO IT AGAIN PLEASE!!!!

Chris Pine doh :3

Sorry, the new Star Trek isn't my Star Trek. In my opinion, it's an implausible, silly recreation of the whole Trek Universe.

I hope, they won't touch TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

Never a sci fi fan, but will be watching it for Khan...Cumberfix alert!

On App Store

Lol get bad robots action movie free and it has this Star Trek weapons

Star Trek: into the lens flare 


Star wars is better. The views say it all.

Darth Vader is Luke's father  #Spoiler

star wars is better 

Boring movie


hummmmmmmmmmmmm

People saying this is a bad movie clearly haven't seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
That VGER sequence Goddamn....

TRAILER IS GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE IS TEN TIMES BETTER.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC, CAN WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN...LOVED THAT OTHER FEDERATION SHIP BREAKING WARP AND ACTUALLY CATCHING IT..WAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE MAKERS OF LOST TV SHOW :)

the music for this trailer kinda sounds like the music for the deus ex trailer 

On and off and on and off try and watch a 2 minute clip takes 5 minutes. Is it just me? Is this just something I have to get used to? Is there some trick to being able to watch a utube video straight thru without all the pauses? 

this was a great trailer...and a great film

This movie was boss! I have watched ALL the Star Treks, and I can tell you that this movie tops them all.

Take the Charlie x out of Chris Pine.  Call Joe Pine and Joe Friday for advice.  Even Roger Moore would be good.  Needs a fence placed between characters.  How can you say "Don't destroy the one named Kirk"without laughing.

is this film any good? I never been into star trek before but like doctor who?

An honest synopsis: A 13 year old boy, inexplicably, takes control of the enterprise and leads the cast of fashion models on a space journey that makes no sense.

What's the name of the song from the beginning til 0:30?

Bring Back William Shatner as Captain Kirk in the third movie!!

One thing I don't understand (& I had to share it with fan-boys).. how is it that in the pursuit sequence, where Enterprise is hunted by Vengeance, Enterprise got shot down out of Warp.. all crew were like "Oh, Our Comms & Weapons Are Off-Line, We Cannot Fire & We Cannot Call For Help".. than after Kirk & Khan land on Vengeance, what does Spock do: USES COMMS TO CHIT-CHAT WITH VOLCAN #2 & HIS ELDERLY SELF..!!! Now corect me if I'm wrong, but weren't comms OFF just a second ago, which ultimately made it "impossible" for them to call Earth (which is btw is 200K Kilometers away.. So unless Volcan#2 is based on the Moon, it makes as much sense as Chupachabra eating ice-cream.. Or if using basic logic, you would think that in their presented future, with all the star ships & all the tech, they will have incy wincy more powerful radars on Earth than today.. & today's radars can detect an ant fart on Alpha Centauri.. So how is it in future they cannot see that a massive unidentified ship is raping Enterprise 200K kilometers/miles away.. Well, next time if J. J. is making such mistakes I'm kicking his ass.. Be aware Mr Abrams, we're watching you..

Best Star trek in Into The Darkness....

Star Wars is and always will be better.

Great villain... I love khan

Guy fron honest trailers!

People are saying the new Star Trek looks more like Star Wars. I get more of a Mass Effect feeling when I watch them.

It's amusing to see the Trekkers underselling the flaws of the original series in order to help their arguments that this film is bad, despite it mostly being about its faithfulness. Aside from the fact that these films are actually closer to Roddenberry's original idea of the series (read the history of the pilot episode and the original conceptualisation of Star Trek), the series doesn't escape weak plotting, terrible pacing, hokey dialogue, and wooden acting. There was a reason why it was originally cancelled, and only really returned on the graces of children and a reignited fascination with outer space thanks to Star Wars. These arguments against Abrams' films are no different than the complaints raised when Next Generation started (which is the incarnation that truly experienced popularity, far ahead of the original series). 

Garbage, way too cheesy

I am new to Star Trek. I really liked this movie. Can a real Trekkie tell me if this was a good movie to you?

The aesthetics of the movie is so grandeur that it was distracting. The movie lacked development of a strong storyline, not only is this a poor attempt to bring back a loved nemesis for attention but a lot of the storyline doesn't align with the legend of "Khan Noonien Singh". I don't think that I sound like an old man when I say that Star Trek:2 was the best Star Trek movie and that this doesn't live up to the "Khan" legend. These writers need to get back to the drawing board and write something good and original , Star Trek is a great sci-fi concept filled with science, politics and warfare backdrops. The writers need to get inspired by history or pick up a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince" because this is purely garage, the events are fantastical without a touch of reality. I know Hollywood is in distress but bring back franchises that are poorly made will bring people to the theaters, make something for this generation, and I would the same for the Scream 4 movie too.

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters.

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.

You know something? I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

I remember hearing people TRYING to find something to complain about with this movie (lens flares etc.) But not once did I hear them complain about the only thing that matters: The characters. Did anyone ever complain about the portrayals of Spock, Kirk or anyone else in Star Trek 2? No. That's what makes this a faithful Star Trek story as opposed to so many of the other re-boot crap that you get from Hollywood.

two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!

GO BENEDICT 

tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of Benedict Cumberbatch ?.

kirk>sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch, in my opinion, is a outstanding actor. His performance in this movie was AMAZING, and so was his voice work as Smaug in The Desolation of Smaug.

I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... 

Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?

I now a lot of hardcore trekkies might hate me for this, but I have only seen ths and the 2009 film, and I really enjoyed the hell out of both movies, except the ending of Into Darkness. But to all who are gonna send me death threats, those films have made me interested in seeing the older movies. 

The new startrek is NOT cerebral,educational,of entertaining. It strictly for the transformer croud.
JJ Abrams obviously doesn't get it.   His tv show also sucked.

If I could make a New Star Trek movie, I would try and make it true to the originals except it will probably not be a good movie even if I am a huge Trekkie and that's being honest. I wouldn't have taken scenes from an older movie though. Star Trek needs a little more creativity than that and it would be better with more original ideas. It could still be Khan but not copying lines and scenes which might have made it easier for older fans to watch and accept.

MUST WATCH!
First of all,
1) It's a ton more awesomer
2) It's epicness is 10 times bigger than the prequel
3) It has Benny Cumberbatch!

it so nice
like playing a game :)

You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.

BENEDICT!!!!!

Sherlock!

Was this realesed in Europe?
I did not renember seeing it on commercials during 2013.

I am always a big fun of Star Trek. Also there is a game Star Trek Destiny of UssEnterprise. Check it out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StarTrekGameSenaNur&hl=en

I wish JJ Abrams had directed the Hobbit.


Peter Jackson is drowning himself in CGI.   Abrams understands how CGI is used in film.  To further a story, not to tell it.  

benedict cumberbatch ?

Benedict is perfect! :)

I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches 

It is NOT startrek anymore, of course not, it's a completely new idea of it. I am a Trekkie, I love the original series, but that doesn't mean, also if I don't talk about these new movies as original, real startrek ones, that they are not worth being watched? Stop saying it's shit because it's new, it's actually a great idea, not the startrek I love, but it's worth to watch

I am so glad I didn't see this trailer before I went to see the movie 1:13 gave away one of the best surprises in the whole movie. I was genuinely caught completely off guard when it came out of nowhere.

They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.

This trailer promised too much

The movie i would like to watch again and again iz star trek...... lop  u actors

The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict Cumberbatch <3

I love the music in this trailer, it's amazingly beautiful, sad, and dramatic.

Now, shaw we begin

mass effect :D

people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'

one of the best movie of all the time , for me ofc :p

Benedict Cumberbatch you legend

Star Trek movies have been entertaining hits and misses.
But this one is plain annoying. The contrast between great cast performances and the glaring issue of 60's uniforms contrasting against 00's high strung beauty parlor decor are far to distracting throughout.

KAHN!!!!!!!!

I'm glad Spock beat the shit and subdued Kahn towards the end of the movie. I always wondered who would fare well in a fight between Vulcans  vs Kahn and his army superhuman genetic freaks

and magically billions of female trekies were born from the sight of cabagepatch

Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of the franchise.

What is the name of the music?

where is commander shephard when you need him!?!

 i miss the summer

The guy who plays Khan I thought he was the voice actor for Sideshow Bob. Sounds so much a like...

YIFY Rocks to download

watching this over and over again just to hear benedict cumberbatch say "now, shall we begin"

Chris Pine is SO cute. 

And so he Spock, and so he Spock, that lord of Castamere...

I don't care for the new Captain Kirk at all. It's the character and him that suck in this movie and the last.  For starters he needs to act more like a Captain and not a raw cadet. Everything else about the movie is ok I guess. I'm a Star Trek fanatic too.
Get rid of whats him name  and spock, too. Make them a little older next time.
Lots of people share the same feeling about the movie as I!!            D

Isn't this the guy from honest movie trailers?

what would make the next film awesome is klingon's lots of klingons and a decent ship to ship battle not the enterprise vs some massive unbeatable ship that is unrealistic for the time period... 

One of the best movies ever!

Oh my Spock

I don't believe in you Jim, you're fictional.

What happened to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy? I mean, I know DeForest Kelley died a while ago, but seriously? J.J. Abrams just failed...epically!

Kirk isn't supposed to just call someone a Son of a *&(%$! I don't even want to watch it! 

 Special effects, cool. Everything else, FAIL!

James T Kirk looks too young to be the captain of a large Starfleet starship.

And why are female Starfleet uniforms sleeveless?

Im sorry but I have a new video on YouTube its a sci fi but a little bit campy its called attack of an alien race form:the aftermath 2 making it a sequel to the original and not a tongue twister but its also a sequel series of attack of an alien race form.

KHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did he call my Benedict a son of a bitch?

Whoever was given the task of making this trailer, they've done a marvelous job!

Epic quote: "I've no idea what I supposed to do, I only know what I can do" (1:37)

A film about good Sylar and evil Sherlock).

Benedict though.

In short, don't like Benedict's Khan. Go watch The Wrath Of Khan and make yourself feel better.

Alright, that's it. I swore to myself I wasn't going to say anything because YouTube wars are stupid, but I can't let these comments on this version of Khan. This isn't 1982. I agree, Ricardo did a great job here. But cut Benedict some slack. 

THIS Star Trek ... is ... FANTASTIC!!!! Exactly the way I LOVE IT, such a charming bad ass, super well done movie, goosebumpy trailer ... YES! J.J. - GREAT JOB!!!

No ship should go down without her captain

Hand JJ over to the Borg! or the Dominion!

Oh My GOD I KNEW IT !!!
Jack Frost is in this movie !! I knew I heard that voice before!

Murmansk, Russia and Djibouti, Djibouti

Lol the shit opinion argument below is priceless! Hahahaha

This movie was 80% lens flares! XD

Yes! Mass Effect deserves to be copied and pasted by whom have been copied and pasted before, haha!

I recommend my friends to watch this movie!, this is so good, I watch it many times!! :)  don't listen to haters, they just jealous.

No ship should go down, without her Captain! - Totally best quote.

I've seen all of TOS and TNG and I loved this movie. Wow it wasn't exactly like TOS, it still was Star Trek and it had a good story. Maybe the lens flare could've been a little toned down though...

I've tried not to mention this but as a child of Spock this bugs me. Before I do I just want to say, I love Kirk, Bones & Scoty to dead. They are spot on. For me one of the key things in "The Raft Of Khan", it was noted Kirks inability to deal with Spock's death since he had never really faced death in that way, yet he broke down when Pike died. The Spock in me finds this although a small blip, a bit bothersome. Don't get me wrong, i love these guys and I'd fly with franchise anytime. ? 

What a shit movie this was. This was bad in all possible ways. Ships that fall from space when they lose power. Overdone emotive crap that was just over the top, and corny. The entire movie looked like a B director had been given a good budget and still made a B movie. Don't waste ur time.

Came here for that Cumberbooty

Anyone into star trek? :D

I could only stand to watch 1 min of this on Netflix.

This isn't Star Trek.....

i have to game (action movie) its like that... but other..............................................................................................................................................

this movie is proof that great acting makes any movie better in any category at all times (I'm talking to you star wars ep 1,2,3)

I swear if Jesus's was to come down he would slap all of us cause star trek into darkness was before wrath of Khan in fact it is actually a 2 hour movie of the episode space seed like in the movie its were the crew first meets khan and at the banished him and his people u damn fools wrath of Khan is 20 years later no your facts niggas.

People who say this is a star trek movie should pipe up and enjoy epic stuff

1:25 and on
Inspirational shit!

Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swear

I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for me

I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice 

people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.

mmm .. i just felt like i've seen the whole movie

Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ 

Awesome movie.

cool

Benedict

only watching this cause benedict is here ;3

WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT MUSIC PLAYING?????!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!

Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first came out! 

I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. 

The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you know,the heart of the Mythos.
