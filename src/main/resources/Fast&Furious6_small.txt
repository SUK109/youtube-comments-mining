cool song, that must be "fast lane" by Bad Meets Evil!

I personlly think furious 6 is better than 7

RIP PAUL WALKER

Best trailer in history!!

the best trailer of the history

??????? ???? ?????

I hope Jensen Ackles would take over Paul Walker in Fast Furious 8

These films are deliberately stupid. It's like a celebration of dumb action movies and Fast 7 makes this one look like a small indy film. Saying that I have never been more entertained while watching a film at the cinema. Love these movies in a tongue and cheek sort of way.

cause it ain't a trailer without girls shaking that ass.

Fast and furious 1 and fast five are the best ones.

LOVE THIS FOREVER <3 !!!

One of the worst movies I have ever seen

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav

5. Fast And Furious 6 
6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A
LL MY FRIENDS....  

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

I enjoyed this movie, but the trailer gives away way too much.



The only reason why this movie is big, cause of Paul Walker's death. People never cared for this movie (I still don't care for this movie) This movie needs to end. But they will milk it for Paul lol. Stupid people.  Now please, tell me you cared for this movie before he died. Cause no one talked about this movie after he died. Bonus points if he's "One of your favorite actor of all time"

cool song, that must be "fast lane" by Bad Meets Evil!

I personlly think furious 6 is better than 7

RIP PAUL WALKER

Best trailer in history!!

the best trailer of the history

??????? ???? ?????

I hope Jensen Ackles would take over Paul Walker in Fast Furious 8

These films are deliberately stupid. It's like a celebration of dumb action movies and Fast 7 makes this one look like a small indy film. Saying that I have never been more entertained while watching a film at the cinema. Love these movies in a tongue and cheek sort of way.

cause it ain't a trailer without girls shaking that ass.

Fast and furious 1 and fast five are the best ones.

LOVE THIS FOREVER <3 !!!

One of the worst movies I have ever seen

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav
1. The Fast And The Furious 
2. Fast Five 
3. The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift 
4. 2 Fast 2 Furious 
5. Fast And Furious 6 
6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

am i the only one who wasn't moved by Paul walkers death? its not like i knew him

worlds longest fuckin runway....

What is the music?

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A
LL MY FRIENDS....  

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

spoiler in 1 video lol

The last line in the movie is when Roman is saying grace and says "and most of all thank you for fast cars" I said that when my mum made me say grace and she slapped me in the head

Right in the feels ... :'(

RIP WALKER

I enjoyed this movie, but the trailer gives away way too much.



The only reason why this movie is big, cause of Paul Walker's death. People never cared for this movie (I still don't care for this movie) This movie needs to end. But they will milk it for Paul lol. Stupid people.  Now please, tell me you cared for this movie before he died. Cause no one talked about this movie after he died. Bonus points if he's "One of your favorite actor of all time"

Garbage

amaing

Can't  wait to see this movie

This trailer just spoiled the movie in so many levels...

Se porta un poco lento en mi huawey g 510 La aplicacion YouTube.

Love this movie,great!!!

guerra  de   chistes

DAMN IT PAUL!
 sigh... miss you man.

this movie was so fucken GAY. i need a refund of 2 hours of my life. 

PLEASE TELL WHAT SONG IS 0;56 

Still a better love story than Twilight... 

ver esto solo me recuerda q jamas va a ser lo mismo sin  #paulwalker  ..q triste lo de este chango

God, this is boring.

I watched. My fav

Its just a movie who cares, its not myth busters ...

Fast and Furious 8.. they take on Alien terrorists in space races and save the galaxy.. mark my words!

????????????????????? ( ?° ? ?°) ????????????????????

R.I.P. Paul !

I've always like the movies they put out if you just like good dialogue good action humor this has got it but a sense of a realism not one bit superman couldn't pull these stunts they do and walk away with just a bruise like who are these guys 

Tokyo Drift is the best F&F

10% Action, 90% Runway. 

FF5 was the best

Fantasy

GENIAL

Haven't seen a Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift...

da

HOW?!?!?!? I thought Paul Walker died.

Dwayne Johsoon is only good actor in this shit movie

Luke Evans looking just Fine.

My favorite movie is Fast Five out of all of them, Fast and the Furious 6 was not really in sync with the movie series. 

That was a good movie

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!

That red car Vin is drying looks BADASS!!!

song from 0:56, does anybody know?

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

Song is Fast Lane 

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

(Y)
RIP PAUL

(Y)
RIP PAUL

Fast and Furious 1-6 best movies ever made poir moi! <3

RIP PAUL WALKER

:?

#1 – The Fast and the Furious (2001)
#2 – 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
#3 – Fast & Furious (2009)
#4 – Fast Five (2011)
#5 – Fast & Furious 6 (2013)

#7 – Fast & Furious 7 (2015)

RiP paul

......wtf @ 1:45 who does this shit

RIP Paul Walker

R.I.P Paul Walker will miss u

Terrible, just a terrible movie

2 fast 2 furious was the best

The last stunt was shit.... Pulling down an Antonov 225 down with some cars is just impossible

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

what's the song name?


omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29
God made us, plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated: from the forbidden fruit – to the first murder, to idiosyncrasies and psyche quirks, to every folly and wickedness; we are so complex when the simple matter is that; God made us, Jesus loves us, and He will change everything for the better from this sin stained world.

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

One of the best trilogy movies i've watched! SUBSCRIBE to my channel and hopefully i will as well! 

I hope the next one after FF7 is good where they make it with pauls brothers join the fast team good movie i just hope its less cop stuff and back to the racing stuff

One of the best Fast & Furious movies.

Bunch of homos having a cocksword fight

Such BS pedestrian movies

cool song, that must be "fast lane" by Bad Meets Evil!

ver esto solo me recuerda q jamas va a ser lo mismo sin  #paulwalker  ..q triste lo de este chango

God, this is boring.

I watched. My fav

Its just a movie who cares, its not myth busters ...

Fast and Furious 8.. they take on Alien terrorists in space races and save the galaxy.. mark my words!

????????????????????? ( ?° ? ?°) ????????????????????

R.I.P. Paul !

I've always like the movies they put out if you just like good dialogue good action humor this has got it but a sense of a realism not one bit superman couldn't pull these stunts they do and walk away with just a bruise like who are these guys 

Tokyo Drift is the best F&F

10% Action, 90% Runway. 

FF5 was the best

Fantasy

GENIAL

Haven't seen a Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift...

da

HOW?!?!?!? I thought Paul Walker died.

Dwayne Johsoon is only good actor in this shit movie

Luke Evans looking just Fine.

My favorite movie is Fast Five out of all of them, Fast and the Furious 6 was not really in sync with the movie series. 

That was a good movie

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!

That red car Vin is drying looks BADASS!!!

song from 0:56, does anybody know?

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

Song is Fast Lane 

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

2 fast 2 furious was the best

The last stunt was shit.... Pulling down an Antonov 225 down with some cars is just impossible

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

what's the song name?


omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29
God made us, plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated: from the forbidden fruit – to the first murder, to idiosyncrasies and psyche quirks, to every folly and wickedness; we are so complex when the simple matter is that; God made us, Jesus loves us, and He will change everything for the better from this sin stained world.

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

One of the best trilogy movies i've watched! SUBSCRIBE to my channel and hopefully i will as well! 

I hope the next one after FF7 is good where they make it with pauls brothers join the fast team good movie i just hope its less cop stuff and back to the racing stuff

One of the best Fast & Furious movies.

Bunch of homos having a cocksword fight

Such BS pedestrian movies

Best trailer in history!!

the best trailer of the history

??????? ???? ?????

I hope Jensen Ackles would take over Paul Walker in Fast Furious 8

These films are deliberately stupid. It's like a celebration of dumb action movies and Fast 7 makes this one look like a small indy film. Saying that I have never been more entertained while watching a film at the cinema. Love these movies in a tongue and cheek sort of way.

cause it ain't a trailer without girls shaking that ass.

Fast and furious 1 and fast five are the best ones.

LOVE THIS FOREVER <3 !!!

One of the worst movies I have ever seen

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav

3. The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift 
4. 2 Fast 2 Furious

6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

Fast and Furious 8.. they take on Alien terrorists in space races and save the galaxy.. mark my words!

????????????????????? ( ?° ? ?°) ????????????????????

R.I.P. Paul !

I've always like the movies they put out if you just like good dialogue good action humor this has got it but a sense of a realism not one bit superman couldn't pull these stunts they do and walk away with just a bruise like who are these guys 

Tokyo Drift is the best F&F

10% Action, 90% Runway. 

FF5 was the best

Fantasy

GENIAL

Haven't seen a Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift...

da

HOW?!?!?!? I thought Paul Walker died.

Dwayne Johsoon is only good actor in this shit movie

Luke Evans looking just Fine.

My favorite movie is Fast Five out of all of them, Fast and the Furious 6 was not really in sync with the movie series. 

That was a good movie

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!

That red car Vin is drying looks BADASS!!!

song from 0:56, does anybody know?

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

I hope the next one after FF7 is good where they make it with pauls brothers join the fast team good movie i just hope its less cop stuff and back to the racing stuff

One of the best Fast & Furious movies.

Bunch of homos having a cocksword fight

Such BS pedestrian movies

Best trailer in history!!

the best trailer of the history

??????? ???? ?????

I hope Jensen Ackles would take over Paul Walker in Fast Furious 8

These films are deliberately stupid. It's like a celebration of dumb action movies and Fast 7 makes this one look like a small indy film. Saying that I have never been more entertained while watching a film at the cinema. Love these movies in a tongue and cheek sort of way.

cause it ain't a trailer without girls shaking that ass.

Fast and furious 1 and fast five are the best ones.

LOVE THIS FOREVER <3 !!!

One of the worst movies I have ever seen

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav
1. The Fast And The Furious 
2. Fast Five 
3. The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift 
4. 2 Fast 2 Furious 
5. Fast And Furious 6 
6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

am i the only one who wasn't moved by Paul walkers death? its not like i knew him

worlds longest fuckin runway....

What is the music?

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A
LL MY FRIENDS....  

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

spoiler in 1 video lol

http://youthtasks.com/?share=35013

Lol @ Paul walkers death.



The last line in the movie is when Roman is saying grace and says "and most of all thank you for fast cars" I said that when my mum made me say grace and she slapped me in the head

Right in the feels ... :'(

RIP WALKER

I enjoyed this movie, but the trailer gives away way too much.



The only reason why this movie is big, cause of Paul Walker's death. People never cared for this movie (I still don't care for this movie) This movie needs to end. But they will milk it for Paul lol. Stupid people.  Now please, tell me you cared for this movie before he died. Cause no one talked about this movie after he died. Bonus points if he's "One of your favorite actor of all time"

Garbage

amaing

Can't  wait to see this movie

This trailer just spoiled the movie in so many levels...

Se porta un poco lento en mi huawey g 510 La aplicacion YouTube.

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav
1. The Fast And The Furious 
2. Fast Five 
3. The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift 
4. 2 Fast 2 Furious 
5. Fast And Furious 6 
6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

am i the only one who wasn't moved by Paul walkers death? its not like i knew him

worlds longest fuckin runway....

What is the music?

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A
LL MY FRIENDS....  

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

spoiler in 1 video lol

http://youthtasks.com/?share=35013

Lol @ Paul walkers death.



The last line in the movie is when Roman is saying grace and says "and most of all thank you for fast cars" I said that when my mum made me say grace and she slapped me in the head

Right in the feels ... :'(

song 
Fat Segal – Clutch 

RIP WALKER

I enjoyed this movie, but the trailer gives away way too much.



The only reason why this movie is big, cause of Paul Walker's death. People never cared for this movie (I still don't care for this movie) This movie needs to end. But they will milk it for Paul lol. Stupid people.  Now please, tell me you cared for this movie before he died. Cause no one talked about this movie after he died. Bonus points if he's "One of your favorite actor of all time"

Garbage

amaing

Can't  wait to see this movie

This trailer just spoiled the movie in so many levels...

Se porta un poco lento en mi huawey g 510 La aplicacion YouTube.

Love this movie,great!!!

guerra  de   chistes

DAMN IT PAUL!
 sigh... miss you man.

this movie was so fucken GAY. i need a refund of 2 hours of my life. 

PLEASE TELL WHAT SONG IS 0;56 

Still a better love story than Twilight... 

ver esto solo me recuerda q jamas va a ser lo mismo sin  #paulwalker  ..q triste lo de este chango

God, this is boring.

I watched. My fav

Its just a movie who cares, its not myth busters ...

Fast and Furious 8.. they take on Alien terrorists in space races and save the galaxy.. mark my words!

????????????????????? ( ?° ? ?°) ????????????????????

R.I.P. Paul !

I've always like the movies they put out if you just like good dialogue good action humor this has got it but a sense of a realism not one bit superman couldn't pull these stunts they do and walk away with just a bruise like who are these guys 

Tokyo Drift is the best F&F

10% Action, 90% Runway. 

FF5 was the best

Fantasy

GENIAL

Haven't seen a Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift...

da

HOW?!?!?!? I thought Paul Walker died.

Dwayne Johsoon is only good actor in this shit movie

Luke Evans looking just Fine.

My favorite movie is Fast Five out of all of them, Fast and the Furious 6 was not really in sync with the movie series. 

That was a good movie

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!

That red car Vin is drying looks BADASS!!!

song from 0:56, does anybody know?

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!

That red car Vin is drying looks BADASS!!!

song from 0:56, does anybody know?

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

RIP Paul Walker

R.I.P Paul Walker will miss u

Terrible, just a terrible movie

2 fast 2 furious was the best

The last stunt was shit.... Pulling down an Antonov 225 down with some cars is just impossible

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

what's the song name?


omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29
God made us, plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated: from the forbidden fruit – to the first murder, to idiosyncrasies and psyche quirks, to every folly and wickedness; we are so complex when the simple matter is that; God made us, Jesus loves us, and He will change everything for the better from this sin stained world.

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

One of the best trilogy movies i've watched! SUBSCRIBE to my channel and hopefully i will as well! 

I hope the next one after FF7 is good where they make it with pauls brothers join the fast team good movie i just hope its less cop stuff and back to the racing stuff

One of the best Fast & Furious movies.

Bunch of homos having a cocksword fight

Such BS pedestrian movies

cool song, that must be "fast lane" by Bad Meets Evil!

I personlly think furious 6 is better than 7

RIP PAUL WALKER

Best trailer in history!!

the best trailer of the history

??????? ???? ?????

I hope Jensen Ackles would take over Paul Walker in Fast Furious 8

These films are deliberately stupid. It's like a celebration of dumb action movies and Fast 7 makes this one look like a small indy film. Saying that I have never been more entertained while watching a film at the cinema. Love these movies in a tongue and cheek sort of way.

cause it ain't a trailer without girls shaking that ass.

Fast and furious 1 and fast five are the best ones.

LOVE THIS FOREVER <3 !!!

One of the worst movies I have ever seen

Why does it look like movie stars have more life than you? Its because they do, but they can only do it while they are acting, you can have it all at anytime all you need is truth, Google *_Truth Contest_* and read the top entry.

One bit I noticed near the start of the film they are supposed to be in Moscow but for some reason they filmed it on a London bridge and computer put in Russia in the background.

When Paul Walker died nobody cared about third person who died whit him.

why there are no comments here?

They Are Some Mistakes I Discovered. 

I Saw A Camera Car And A Camera

hahahahahahhaaa

wow really

Just saw 7 but never this one. This trailor explains a lot about 7 lol. Not a F&F fan but my brother wanted to see 7 so I figured what the hell.

Great OTT action.

Does anyobody knows the song that starts at 0:50 seconds ? Alguien conoce la cancion que comienza al segundo 0:50? Gracias, thank you...

Furious7 is bad###

Its finally on netflix

enjoyed the early & recent F&F's but this is just drawn out drivel , absolute rubbish .
and how long is that army base runway at the end ?????

I don't get the part when there are police coming to Han and Gisele , just why?

Always love you Paul Walker :(

whats the song at 0:56??

Dis one and Tokyo Drift are the best

What's the name of the song on the background?

Please Can anyone help me with soundtrack which starts at 00:56.

R.I.P  Paul Walker the best actor in the movie 

Why'd they cut out that sex scene in the beginning of that trailer?

LOVE IT!!

what did Dom done with another woman at the begining??poor letty?

I thought it said Fast and Furious Sex. XD

I'd say this is about in the middle in terms of best in the franchise. In order of best to worst I'll have to go 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 3, 2

Owen was such a darker and better villian than Deckerd...

Lol Tyrese did take that plane down

77

So hotttttttttttttt ...

did someone just say a TANK?

Who is the blonde girl in the beginning of the trailer? Elsa pataky?

my favorite fast and furious movies from best to least fav
1. The Fast And The Furious 
2. Fast Five 
3. The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift 
4. 2 Fast 2 Furious 
5. Fast And Furious 6 
6. Furious 7 
7. Fast And Furious 


This trailer alone is better than Fast 7

After such an epic instalment, James Wan trashed the series with Furious 7. Please get Justin Lin back! Or stop with 7th one because it was plane stupid and defied all logic and under-utilised all characters except Dom. I would also like the next one to feature Tyrese and Ludacris only. 

fast 1 - 7 rinse n repeat

just spoiled

this was better than fast 7

The Fast And The Furious now is not simply about racing illegally and stealing merchandise to gain money, its now about guys that were a bunch of street racers and low criminals and all of a sudden now have all the knowledge in the world to make a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE operation! they ruined the whole franchise! its like a combination of The Expendables with Mission Impossible! The best ones were The Fast and The Furious and Tokyo Drift which were more related to racing!

SONG / CANCIÓN . MINUTO 0.56  ??

What is the music?

Funny, thing that when you wanna watch a trailer, you dont want to scroll down to comment in case of spoilers, but when it is actually the oppesite!
Check the comments first and see if people say its spoilers in the trailer, men dont watch it :)

Cool movie

I've been on a lot of tarmac's and that one in this movie has to be the longest one eveeeeeer.

Inaccurate met police vehicles.

fast 5 was the best one .. so far :)

Dude that's BAD MEETS EVIL 

I saw this as "Fast & Furious 6 Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Vin Dies" so does vin diesel die in this one?

Got a national threat? Forget the police,swat,cia,fbi or the freakin army. Call in a team of street racers. They are the best for the job. =)

Hi vin diesel sir
U r greate in movie
But we want paul walker

Self indulgent pretentious nonsense.

HELLO A
LL MY FRIENDS....  

R.I.P Paul Walker...

The guy in Tokyo drift woud have been a good choice. He is on NCIS now. Who knows!  RIP Paul.

The movie was great, loved it, but there was one bug I didn't like. (ok there are many like any movie but this one was way too much..maybe for me)
HOW LONG was that airstripe in the finish? If this was not a "movie-sh" stuff would must been 30+ miles at least! 8 minutes to try to takeoff and finally landing.
Don't think there's any base worldwide with such a long airstripe. Anyway I understand there must been something like that, just ..too much :) But anyway, nice job all around.
RIP Paul Walker ...... w8ing for 7th FF to be something like tribute to him.

I love the movie,  but with such big blockbuster,  they shouldn't have small mistakes like using a different baby in few different shots.  Good movie regardless.  

There's probably no movie series with better trailers than FF <3

spoiler in 1 video lol

Stupid people.  Now please, tell me you cared for this movie before he died. Cause no one talked about this movie after he died. Bonus points if he's "One of your favorite actor of all time"

its nothing without walker

Woh man... I didn't realize that they show a good chunk of the movie....

worst F&F...the 7th will be better

0:44 about a week ago.. a week ago

What's the song at 2:20 in the background?



Paul Walker where ever you are in the afterlife you've been the greatest actor I've ever known R.I.P ?

This movie is alright, but it is probably my least favorite of the six movies so far. I personally didn't care for the way they portrayed Owen Shaw. I don't like it when the villain is that crazy, that senseless, that smart, and that far ahead of everybody else. I like it when the villain is being led into the biggest, fattest trap, and they don't even know it.

Song is Fast Lane 

You people WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND why we fans of Fast And Furious Stay loyal, you think we watch the movies for the cars or whatever, the cars are just intermediates for the real plot, the Hetero "Bromance" between Brian and Dom, and how Brian becomes part of doms family

paul walker didnt die yet when  this was film u muppets!

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Need track from 0:57 

best in the series

ludacris is the best actor of all time... lolz

Paul Walker couldn't show emotion in a film to save his life. And look where that got him lol.



Fast and Furious 6 is awesome but there are more movies that are closer to my heart.
Down bellow are my lists of Best Fast and Furious movies:
1) The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2) Fast Five (2011)
3) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
4) Fast and Furious 6 (2013)
5) Fast & Furious 4 (2009)
6) The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Luke Evans & Gina Carano made this film cool for me, but no way in hell do I buy a group of street thugs as being the best heist crew in the world.

May you rest in peace..Paul Walker.

0:56 would like to know the soundtrack...

Too soon :-(

whats the song

anyone know the soundtrack playing in this trailer, the first one  :D

It's the trailer for fast and furious 5 just says 6 at the end


Yeah that's true paul walker was always the good guy and the one that ride or die in all the fast furious movie that only two ones that was good way part one and the one with Eva Mendes 

I miss you Paul!!!

Games suck
Video suck
Cars going to suck?

WHERE IS TUNING FFS!??!?!?!?!??!?!!????????!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!!@^#!$&^*!(#IL"E?RF

This movie will most likely suck when released, too many exaggerated scenes.

Rip vin deeisl 

You go from racing ricer fart can cars in the first movie to toppling underworld gangs of the world. Please. What's next, outter space? A series for moron homos.

I like the women's attitudes in this movie. The men say "Someone's in trouble, I've got to go" and women say "Absolutely, you've got to go"; none of this "But you promised you wouldn't do this anymore; if you leave, this is The End!"

Rip big Paul mate

you dont turn your back on them, even if they do.

Isn't Paul Walker supposed to be the main character in these movies ? Saying that, cuz we barely see him in this trailer.

PS: RIP Paul :(

cool movie, I enjoyed this one…

Why can't a person be loved and admired whilst walking amongst us? 

whats the song? :)

I miss Paul Walker :(

Why did I think this was a new trailer for Fast and Furious 7... Saw this in theaters last year -_-

Terrible, just a terrible movie

2 fast 2 furious was the best

The last stunt was shit.... Pulling down an Antonov 225 down with some cars is just impossible

RIP Paul you were the best we had.

what's the song name?


omg this was 1 of the best movies i ever seen! fkn awsum n action everywhere!!!

Trailers these days just give away too much of the actual movie

complete shit!

What if Lucas Black from Tokyo drift took over the fast and furious franchise after the seventh movie ?  

R.i.p paul. 

You know that everything in the fast and the furious movies is physically and technical possible.

The front cover of this movie has 666 subliminally. The letter "F" is the 6th letter in the alphabet which translates FF6 to 666

this is the last FF I ever watch their will never be a replacement to match Paul Walker

Damn!  This was a great movie!  RIP Paul Walker.  You are still very much missed.

R.I.P Paul Walker<3 You're missed.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE   Ecclesiastes 7:29
God made us, plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated: from the forbidden fruit – to the first murder, to idiosyncrasies and psyche quirks, to every folly and wickedness; we are so complex when the simple matter is that; God made us, Jesus loves us, and He will change everything for the better from this sin stained world.

The comments in this video have given me cancer.

Living life in the fast lane..

One of the best trilogy movies i've watched! SUBSCRIBE to my channel and hopefully i will as well! 

I hope the next one after FF7 is good where they make it with pauls brothers join the fast team good movie i just hope its less cop stuff and back to the racing stuff

One of the best Fast & Furious movies.

Bunch of homos having a cocksword fight

Such BS pedestrian movies

Still a better love story than Twilight... 

ver esto solo me recuerda q jamas va a ser lo mismo sin  #paulwalker  ..q triste lo de este chango

God, this is boring.

I watched. My fav

Its just a movie who cares, its not myth busters ...

Fast and Furious 8.. they take on Alien terrorists in space races and save the galaxy.. mark my words!

????????????????????? ( ?° ? ?°) ????????????????????

R.I.P. Paul !

I've always like the movies they put out if you just like good dialogue good action humor this has got it but a sense of a realism not one bit superman couldn't pull these stunts they do and walk away with just a bruise like who are these guys 

Tokyo Drift is the best F&F

10% Action, 90% Runway. 

FF5 was the best

Fantasy

GENIAL

Haven't seen a Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift...

da

HOW?!?!?!? I thought Paul Walker died.

Dwayne Johsoon is only good actor in this shit movie

Luke Evans looking just Fine.

My favorite movie is Fast Five out of all of them, Fast and the Furious 6 was not really in sync with the movie series. 

That was a good movie

I like the movie. And I. Like the. Final part

? ????? ????? ??????? - ????? ?????????? ???????????! ??????? ???????!
