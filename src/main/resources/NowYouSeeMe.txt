I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable.

if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

Best movie ever

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

iwantmovies.info

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

JESSE EISENBERG SUCH A GOOD ACTOR :D I really like the way how he is in movies :D

Watch and win at
iwantmovies.info

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

Mind-blowing movie.

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable.

Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM

Mind-blowing movie.

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

JESSE EISENBERG SUCH A GOOD ACTOR :D I really like the way how he is in movies :D

Watch and win at
iwantmovies.info

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!

In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

love this movie!

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

Now you se me...now you don't. ;D

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!
 

this movie is full of massage from secret societies...
“Come in close. Closer. Because now you know our secret. We could be anywhere. Watching you. We’re looking for someone to help us with our next trick. On the count of three, open your eyes and tell me what you see. One. Two …”
if you know what it means..

A really amazing movie. A movie that u can watch more than once for that matter. I enjoyed the acors & the movie plot. Tricky, interested & magical of course ;) Movie: 10 out of 10!

This movie was really great but it was such a rip off of "The Prestige," which is an even better movie so I highly recommend that movie to anyone who liked this.

can anyone tell me where can i watch this in full movie without going to the cinema?

Best movie ever


what a fantastic movie.. the person behind it was so unexpected 

What a great movie :))

WATCHING 

Now I see why he was cast as Lex Luthor.

Amazing......now im waiting for part too
it better hurry
plzzzzzzzzzz

where do i watch it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?

One of the best movies in the last few years I've seen

Cant wait for the sequel! As a writer I began having ideas when I walked out of the theater. lol

OMG it is an awesome movie loved it. highly recommend those people who r now in  mood of watching some thing thrilling. I assure u that after watching this  movie u will feel fantastic.

Omfg


absolutely fantastic. like a breath of fresh air. 

The ending was quite predictable to be honest, I thought who it would most likely be and it turned out to be that person. Also, this movie has no character development AT ALL. Still quite entertaining if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched it on an airplane during a 12 hour trip.

this movie was fire

I never got to finish the movie !! 

amazing movie. probably the best i've ever seen +HeresMrIsaac 

movie is excellent..... but why it is panned by critics..... any way most underrated movie

Great movie and actorsss

Jess Einsenberg is hot now :o no more socially awkward. 

Watched and love the film

So amazing saw it yesterday blew my mind 

Just watched this movie and now I just want to punch someone and have a little cry

I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

loved this movie

Awesome movie 


a bit of a show off and a lot of fuzz..for a more than predictable movie...Jesse Eisenberg is not convincent, Woody Harrelson reveals more than ever is "stiffness" as an actor. In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!


dave franco

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie


movies at
iwantmovies.info

so does this mean to sit at the back of the cinema? lol

I want to watch this movie so bad!

Saw this movie yesterday, amazing !!!!

Is this the new inception?

Spoiler alert the FBI boi is the head master

I Love This movie. I Watch the full version of This I can watch it over and over again

The most retarded movie ever!

i totally recommend this amazing movie!

In between the four there's not enough magic to make it worth...there's no spark in it. there's lot of "deja vu" (my favorite word for it) that not even Michael Caine manages to fix. after watching it the feeling is comparable to give a bath to our caniche..when the fur gets water the real skinny dog appears...and its a lot smaller and not really as special as it looked before:)

the movie is awesome!!  but the ending really surprised me... and.. that was a bad surprise...

+zhannell feve - what is with the 1's?  o:

Honestly i thought this movie was really bad,  I wouldn't recommended it, the ending will leave you being like "okay..... that's it?"

I love this Movie <3 <3

when i saw them, i screamed, ZOMBIE LAND!!11!!!!!!!!!!


i want to watch


?????? My last pay check was $8500 working 10 hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for  months now  and he works about 22 hours a week. I can't believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is what I do, ???????? JUMP26.COM
??????????Americans…still believe in an America wHeres what I do,e anything’s possible – they just don’t think their leaders do.



I miss this comment system ;)

THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! DIDN'T EXPECT A LOT!!!

I love this film *-* <3 <3

yeah.. n downloaded it just after watching the trailer.

Ah, Celldweller makes this movie seem even better.
He should do the music for all trailers.

dhoom 3 is like a kid infront of this!

hahahahahhahaha very true .....

no


watch this great movie at iwantmovies.info

i seen the movie it was so awsome

Who the hell said that Dhoom 3 is based on Now You see me.In my opinion its totally different.There are many fools in this world


This movie is so overly unbelievable, even for a magic movie it fucking sucks.

BEST MOVIE EVER

I love this movie!

Absoutely harsh to compare dhoom 3 trailer with this faltu pic.

Who the fucking bitch where said dhoom 3 trailer is looks like now you see me

dhoom 3 finished shooting before now you see me released. r u mad?

Dhoom 3 u r caught :-D

Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see....

click like if you came here after watching dhoom 3 trailer 

Mind-blowing movie. 


what is the full movie name for download??

Because he didn't. he is the distraction for the audience, watch the movie again.

Best entertainment movie ever!!!
I cannot tell about this impression.
Cuz if I tell something about this, you feel bored when you watch this.

he needed to be the one in charge of the case, so he can let them roam around freely, ( that's why he didn't like the french chick being his partner) but he didn't want people to suspect him, and that's why he acted that way.

Remind me of Kaito Kid "The Phantom Thief" from Detective Conan anime. The thief who love to perform magic while to rob diamond...! This movie sound interesting to me!!

Honestly, this movie was great up until the end. What they do is seriously amazing. Why they do it is boring. Everything they did lead up to a very lack luster ending. The romance felt forced and cheesy like it really didn't have much of a place in the movie. "The eye" is... stupid. The movie lost it's cool points with the cheesy ending for me. I really love the whole premise of magicians stealing and giving back. Like a magical Robin Hood. It was cool.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Pirania doesn't attack human.

amazing movie, one of my favourites!

such a great movie!

This movie is amazingly awesome.

I loved this movie! 

might? get it now!

I'm guessing he did that to really fool and make morgan freeman's character not see that he is actually the mastermind,Just rewatch the "prison cell" scene again, you will understand.

so..fucking..underrated!!

...continued... According to Wikipedia:
"Although some interpretations differ, in most accounts, the four riders are seen as symbolizing Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively." Now you just have to see who / what Dylan symbolises as, and you unfold everything the Matrix talks about... Take the red pill, bro :)

Go behind the symbolics of the movie and you understand that it's all about the state of the world economics today. I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer is FULL of suggestions for people to "wake the fuck up" to the reality of our world. You can watch "The Four Horsemen" documentary on Youtube to begin with... I'm of course assuming, that what I'm telling you isn't obvious and that you are still "sleeping" regarding the situation, so please forgive me if you aren't...

Wow, Finally some good programming for the sheeples!

This movie was amazingly good, it's so underrated! 

This ist best movie ever xD

So original. Love it!

A good movie. The storyline was a bit ridiculous, but everything else was solid.

okay i loved the movie but i have a major question and note this is spoiler territory:

Why was Dylan Chasing the four horseman with extreme scrutiny when he himself planned the entire thing???

The best movie I have ever seen ?

Excellent movie, would definitely reccomend

I might rent it

The FBI Agent is the real master mind of 4 magicians. 

Is a trailer within a trailer like a dream within a dream?

I love this Movie!! omg! one of my favorites! 

Ive literally liked every single movie Jesse Eisenberg has EVER been in.. It is bizarre but that man is GREAT at picking films and characters that suit him. Usually being the outcast loser, druggie, charismatic smart ass, or a just a freaking genius lol 

great film,
watchthismovie.me

It was amazing until the ending... The ending is common (nowadays) and predictable. 

i'm actually in love with this movie

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

How Mark Ruffalo(The FBI Detective), in the 2nd show(with the 140 millions) was sitting next to the Interpol agent and in the same time he was wearing a hoodie and standing behind the black lady(who got 70.000 more dollars in her bank account)?

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

Love this movie

i loved this movie!

I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. 

Epic movie, loved it!!!

yes it is

Tallahassee and Columbus from Zombieland... together in another movie... AWESOME XD

Loved it!!


MAGIC !


how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring

I just watched this movie, and I swear this is one of the best movies ever made

seriously? islam will prevail? wrong, Christ will prevail. Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

Muhammad is a joke. im all about religious freedom, however if you are a part of a group that believes everyone else who is not a part of it should die and rewards for helping them get there should be removed from existence.. just saying.

 

None the less fool. Islam will prevail :) Wait till death, I can't wait to laugh at your face. :D

awsome movie


This was actually way better then I thought

i know right!!

MAGIC as you call it is just fast hands, perfect light, lots of mirrors, Chemical reaction and or dumb mind who cant understand the BIG picture. 
And there is nothing about Satan. 
You can call all mobile phone magic, TV, Touchscreen's, Cameras even a lighter is magic.
There is No MAGIC.

SPOILER: the movie ends with the credits

This film is amazing but illuminati.

@John Stewart...MAGIC is also Gods work according to the wonderful fairy tale book called the bible.

Exact proof the illuminati exists! Magic is Satans work. Why do you think "witches" were hung back in the past? Not 'cause it was "black" but because it was MAGIC. And people don't like its presence except you fools that don't see the big picture. Enjoyment and entertainment all a lie till we actually wake from our deep sleep today every day until we die. haha good luck after that. hahahahaha! 'Cause magic wont be there to save your sorry souls. :D

why? because they masked logical flaws with a "surprise" ending? Not good enough for me.

The big twist at the end :O

It's been confirmed their is a sequel:D

Did anyone say Shaco?

LOVED the movie.

This movie was AMAZING! I hope theirs a sequel!!!! :D

I love this move is yest ameisin

Nooo @tempest Nirvana he is amazing and hot and I love him!!! He is perfect 4 any role!!

Loved the movie, I think mark ruffalo is a good actor but to me didn't fit the role he was given. You gotta watch the ending to have an idea of what I mean by this.

Watched this and it was sooo freaking good!!!

I just watched this and did NOT expect the ending! I loved it!


Liked everything about this movie !

Amazing movie, definetly 10/10 Didn't think I would like it, totally loved it after first 30 minutes.

What a glorious turd of a movie. Good job on making a magic turd. Abracaturdra. 

Its AMAZING. It is definitely worth your time

First time I watch this trailer thought the French guy is Robert Downey Jr.

Was anyone else constantly distracted by Isla Fisher's legs in this movie?

there's gonna be a 3rd movie? daamn!

what is the name of the youngest Magician?

Omg why !!!!


***WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*  The cop that asked how they got to Paris from Las Vegas in 3 seconds is working with the magicians.

so is this movie worth my time?

when i seen those cards i was like "persona"?
then at the end i was like "OMG he said it"!

And then "No You Di'n't"

Great story to bad the actors where all losers except Morgan freeman, then it could have been a great movie.

Well, I got some conspiracy theory that the review shit is just to make the impression about the movie contain some people robbing the rich (who obviously the rich who rob from poor) to give to the victim (we, to be precise) are bad. But what do you say, magic wins!

yes

This should be getting much better reviews -_-

HOLY SHIT CELLDWELLER MADE MUSIC FOR THIS! CELLDWELLER - SHUT EM DOWN!

One of the worst movies i have ver seen, first 5 minutes are okay , but then it looks like the writer of the plot smoked a joint,lol.
What a huge waste of amazing actors , the movie was just silly , the ending is awful , if you're a 12 years old you'll probably like it, they try to make the movie logical but they fail.;
anyways the movie is mind you , a piece of crap ,wasted 2 hours .

epic!!

This movie is awesome I love movies that mix up your mind, like  inception, it's true what they say on reviews you can't make it real but that's what calls your attention, this is the best movie since like 1 year ago, and the cast spectacular, you could never imagine such good talent together, they fit perfectly, I seriously hope for a second one, this movie was perfect from beginning to end, Recommend it

this's one of the most unpredictable i've ever seen

Loved this movie

So true though. Why is Michael Caine in all these magic movies?

The Prestige II: The Prestiger

how did this get in here?

One of the few great films of recent, and it doesn't ruin the entire plot in the trailer!

why? I thought it was awesome.

why did this movie got so much bad reviews? it was amazing

The super bruce manner cant seem to understand the power of the iron hores/ eye

You must be a retard. I never said everyone is gonna die and go to hell and crap. That's you, I love every one but the FACT is Islam will prevail. Christ will come and say He aint what yall think he is and you will all think he is "fake" but you'll be too stupid to understand. Patience young retard. Just a little longer. Plus don't talk shit about our Prophet when I aint talkin' shit bout your religion. 

If you wanna waste 2 hrs of your time watch this

Boring
