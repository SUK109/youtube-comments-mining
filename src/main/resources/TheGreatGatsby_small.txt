the best trailer ever

I don't care what anyone says, this film is still amazing

i loved the book and thought this movie was great. i don't know why it got so many poor reviews.

Piece of shit movie, the book was better. Leo was shit too.

In the end, the woman with red hair shouted TOM TOM, why didn't anyone hear it? The horn wasn't that loud!

This trailer gives the movie a whole different tone.

Spider-Man+Jack+Shahensha=???

I cannot unhear Spider-Man when I watch this movie.

Easily one of the best movies

I go to school in London so we don't get to read The Great Gatsby. In retrospect, I'm actually happy they make us read Shakespeare and classic novels like this because when would we ordinarily get the chance to read them. Maybe i'll try reading The Great Gatsby sometime.

I love this trailer soooo much ?

this movie is so fuckin sad and Daisy is an asshole.

can someone tell me the song?

dat bitch ....

The Great Gatspy By : Sir. Scott Fitzgerald! 
? I'm reading the book!

Daisy sadly is the definition of a gold digger.

They blew it. Di Caprio was born to play this role, and he played it perfectly. But they miscalculated on just about every other aspect of this movie. The book and the whole story, is about the times, and it should be properly set, and rooted in the times, i.e. no modern dance music. And the sets were cartoony at best, and unrealistically grandiose at worst. No - it' just didn't work, but that was no fault of Di Caprio's.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

Tobey my baby

Fantastic book! Really shows how the "idea" of having something, is better than the actual thing, and how in the 20's people would do anything for wealth. Daisy gave up true love for wealth, and she did so very knowingly.....just a fantastically profound book.??

What is this movie about? Lol

Perfect casting

This trailer is so beautiful.

Some of the ugliest bitches are in this movie

Spider-Man

so what's the meaning of it's all make. sense?

Warning: DO NOT read the comments. It is FILLED with spoilers.

nice movie,  and 1:39 reminded me mafia 1 XD

what song is that in the very beginning???

The Great Gatsby is one of those novels you might of read and regret doing so being indifferent to what happens to the character by the time you put it down.

one of the greatest movies of our generation

*in 1938 daisy dies,actually she gets burned to death* Ohk now  umm feeling a lot better

If my grandmother's still alive, she'd be cursing Daisy to death. Yeah, that's how my grandma reacts to every villain that she sees if she's still alive.

Ending is so fucked up

If i cry on this movie, and also on every movie by leonardo dicrapio when is die, I think the problem is at me, I am gay ? :)))

Wait did daisy find out at the end tht he got shot? Like did she not love him if she knew?

By the time she was a 40 or 50 year old woman, Daisy would definitely have deeply regretted not going with her heart and going with Gatsby. Then again, she's not the type of woman that deserves love anyways.

The story of Gatsby is basically mine... I just don't know how to get rich haha

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete. And though the movie adaptations of books are almost never as good as the book itself, this movie is phenomenal. It is not only beautifully made, but it's accurate, following the book by its words. Bravo to the author of the book and the writers of the movie.

The fim that made Leo absolutly hate Baz Luhrmann.

I didn't like how they put the rap in the sound track.  I liked the movie, but I certainly didn't love it.

Now, Robert Redford was a handsome Gatsby though!

This movie was so similar to Romeo n Juliet it made me cry T.T

What's the intro song called? The one at the beginning before the thunderstorm scene.

aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece

Starting this for A level ??

Whats the song in first part of the trailer?

Game for when you watch the movie: take a shot every time gatsby says "old sport"

poor Gatsy...doing all these things for someone that is not worth pursuing...

Sophomores? Anyone?

I just don't understand these kind of movie

Love or hate him, you gotta admit. Baz Lurhmann sure has an eye for beauty

Still confused what its about...

Thumbs up if your reading this for english

I really could feel how intense Daisy's love for Gatsby was. The actress did her character much justice. It's a shame though, that Daisy Buchanan couldn't overcome her self loathing relationship, and her materialistic view on the world.

Is this movie any good?

wasn't the soundtrack supposed to be "will u still love me" by lena del ray?

What was the song at the very beginning

Parker?

My favorite movie! Excellent cast! Well done. Bravo! Superb soundtrack. I can't get enough.

plz I want the full movie

I really hate Daisy more than Tom.

best movie in the world

I have to read the book for school. I hope it's good

HE WAITED FOR THIS BITCH AND SHE DIDNT EVEN CALL FUCK ME UP THIS FILM MAN

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!

This movie has the worst soundtrack

I watched it in my history class

daisy bitch -_- . I've never been so angry at a character like this before

Why the sountrack rap?....This was jazz...roaring 20's. I turned it off....couldn't watch it.

Absolutely love the film, but the book really is great - Fitzgerald novel is to subtle to be captured fully in a film

if the one who rich as hell like gasby cannot even get his woman, so how the hell on earth a poor guy like me can ?  :c

Best film I've ever watched

this book inspired me as a young man.

I love this movie

Baz Luhrmann had a horrible vision for this film and it turned out to be a disappointment.

I 
Really
Don't 
Get 
It

the song name plz 1:10 to 1:54

anyone here from the harry styles Edit????

the book is so amazing

nice movie

They could do a modern version set in 2019.

Such an underrated movie

The most boring movie I have ever seen

Elon Musk... anyone?

The movie was really great. And Leo did a awesome god portraying Gatsby. Recommend you watch it, bet you'll like it

We also need Tender is the night!

nice movie !

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

the best trailer ever

And though the movie adaptations of books are almost never as good as the book itself, this movie is phenomenal. It is not only beautifully made, but it's accurate, following the book by its words. Bravo to the author of the book and the writers of the movie.

The fim that made Leo absolutly hate Baz Luhrmann.

I didn't like how they put the rap in the sound track.  I liked the movie, but I certainly didn't love it.

Now, Robert Redford was a handsome Gatsby though!

This movie was so similar to Romeo n Juliet it made me cry T.T

What's the intro song called? The one at the beginning before the thunderstorm scene.

aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece

Starting this for A level ??

Whats the song in first part of the trailer?

Game for when you watch the movie: take a shot every time gatsby says "old sport"

poor Gatsy...doing all these things for someone that is not worth pursuing...

Sophomores? Anyone?

I just don't understand these kind of movie

Love or hate him, you gotta admit. Baz Lurhmann sure has an eye for beauty

Still confused what its about...

Thumbs up if your reading this for english

I really could feel how intense Daisy's love for Gatsby was. The actress did her character much justice. It's a shame though, that Daisy Buchanan couldn't overcome her self loathing relationship, and her materialistic view on the world.

Is this movie any good?

wasn't the soundtrack supposed to be "will u still love me" by lena del ray?

What was the song at the very beginning

Parker?

My favorite movie! Excellent cast! Well done. Bravo! Superb soundtrack. I can't get enough.

plz I want the full movie

I really hate Daisy more than Tom.

best movie in the world

I have to read the book for school. I hope it's good

HE WAITED FOR THIS BITCH AND SHE DIDNT EVEN CALL FUCK ME UP THIS FILM MAN

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!

This movie has the worst soundtrack

I watched it in my history class

daisy bitch -_- . I've never been so angry at a character like this before

Why the sountrack rap?....This was jazz...roaring 20's. I turned it off....couldn't watch it.

Absolutely love the film, but the book really is great - Fitzgerald novel is to subtle to be captured fully in a film

if the one who rich as hell like gasby cannot even get his woman, so how the hell on earth a poor guy like me can ?  :c

Best film I've ever watched

this book inspired me as a young man.

I love this movie

Baz Luhrmann had a horrible vision for this film and it turned out to be a disappointment.

I 
Really
Don't 
Get 
It

the song name plz 1:10 to 1:54

anyone here from the harry styles Edit????

the book is so amazing

nice movie

They could do a modern version set in 2019.

Such an underrated movie

The most boring movie I have ever seen

Elon Musk... anyone?

The movie was really great. And Leo did a awesome god portraying Gatsby. Recommend you watch it, bet you'll like it

We also need Tender is the night!

nice movie !

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

the best trailer ever

I don't care what anyone says, this film is still amazing

i loved the book and thought this movie was great. i don't know why it got so many poor reviews.

Piece of shit movie, the book was better. Leo was shit too.

In the end, the woman with red hair shouted TOM TOM, why didn't anyone hear it? The horn wasn't that loud!

This trailer gives the movie a whole different tone.

Spider-Man+Jack+Shahensha=???

I cannot unhear Spider-Man when I watch this movie.

Easily one of the best movies

I go to school in London so we don't get to read The Great Gatsby. In retrospect, I'm actually happy they make us read Shakespeare and classic novels like this because when would we ordinarily get the chance to read them. Maybe i'll try reading The Great Gatsby sometime.

I love this trailer soooo much ?

this movie is so fuckin sad and Daisy is an asshole.

can someone tell me the song?

dat bitch ....

The Great Gatspy By : Sir. Scott Fitzgerald! 
? I'm reading the book!

Daisy sadly is the definition of a gold digger.

They blew it. Di Caprio was born to play this role, and he played it perfectly. But they miscalculated on just about every other aspect of this movie. The book and the whole story, is about the times, and it should be properly set, and rooted in the times, i.e. no modern dance music. And the sets were cartoony at best, and unrealistically grandiose at worst. No - it' just didn't work, but that was no fault of Di Caprio's.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

Tobey my baby

Fantastic book! Really shows how the "idea" of having something, is better than the actual thing, and how in the 20's people would do anything for wealth. Daisy gave up true love for wealth, and she did so very knowingly.....just a fantastically profound book.??

What is this movie about? Lol

Perfect casting

This trailer is so beautiful.

Some of the ugliest bitches are in this movie

Spider-Man

so what's the meaning of it's all make. sense?

Warning: DO NOT read the comments. It is FILLED with spoilers.

nice movie,  and 1:39 reminded me mafia 1 XD

what song is that in the very beginning???

The Great Gatsby is one of those novels you might of read and regret doing so being indifferent to what happens to the character by the time you put it down.

one of the greatest movies of our generation

*in 1938 daisy dies,actually she gets burned to death* Ohk now  umm feeling a lot better

If my grandmother's still alive, she'd be cursing Daisy to death. Yeah, that's how my grandma reacts to every villain that she sees if she's still alive.

Ending is so fucked up

If i cry on this movie, and also on every movie by leonardo dicrapio when is die, I think the problem is at me, I am gay ? :)))

Wait did daisy find out at the end tht he got shot? Like did she not love him if she knew?

By the time she was a 40 or 50 year old woman, Daisy would definitely have deeply regretted not going with her heart and going with Gatsby. Then again, she's not the type of woman that deserves love anyways.

The story of Gatsby is basically mine... I just don't know how to get rich haha

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete.

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

Can we just look at this then look at the new ghostbuster trailer. This is nothing short of a majestic work of art.

5

SOON FUCKING HAWT ?

One of the few times that the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. Seriously watch it, it's amazing!!!

Daisy is such a lame character.Almost cried at the end.Masterpiece.

such a captivating movie . with an elegance of it's own . I sure hope to experience another film like "the great Gatsby" again . because I was drown to this world of wonderful charms and different kinds of people who live to  be surfaced again to realty of the touching End

We never read this in any of my English classes, I read it because I wanted to and I absolutely loved it!

I love this Trailer <3

whats the song

Honestly, this was a good anime but I prefer the manga way more.

which is the name of the second song?

Lol I was made to read this for my English lit class, but I enjoyed it, why is everyone complaining?

Such a boring book made into something majestic. Honestly favourite movie

Shes such A BITCH. u know who i am talking about.

the best movie i ever watched
every time left with tears in the eye
Can somebody answer WHY PEOPLE ARE SO MEAN...

the ending makes me so angry every time I watch or think about it. The least daisy could have done or anyone in fact other than nick go to gatsby's funeral and I can't believe she let him take the fall for what she did and she went crawling back to her cheating husband I wish they would've died instead

I hate the ending to this story. I wish Tom and Daisy got what they deserved. I wish Nick wouldn't had let Jay's reputation go down the drain. I cried so much at the end..

0:17 what is that song?

It seems like the Roaring 20s, right after ww1 which devastated Europe, was when the US first became the world's most powerful nation

diasy=cheap whore

hi

I'm making a trailer for my presentation in class because we read the novel and it's hard coming up with ideas with just pictures I need help?

whats the song at the beginning

Só essa música que nada a ver ne pessoal

Amazing movie!

I need to know the name of the first song! Does anyone knows? PLEASE! Gess it's Kanye?

finished the book in school and starting watching the movie today and I just finished the whole movie and loved it!!!
Love Leonardo DiCaprio

Gatsby dies.

And this is why you don't EVER see women doing this love traingle stuff. No woman will EVER do this for a man, well, i retract my comment, it all depends on his wallet.

Everything for love...

This is such a amazing movie! ???

??? ???????????? ????? ???? ????

I watched it bcz of Big B the legend

We are reading this in class right now and there's a ton of people complaining how it's too difficult to read and that it's boring. I don't understand why they think that?? This is one of the most beautiful book to be ever written in my opinion and there is so much meaning behind it. I mean the book is only 8 or 9 chapters so it's not that hard. it's disappointing

Forced to read the book in English. much better then this shit movie tho.

I hate this book :)

This is basically the orgin story of Spider Man. lol

I love the1920s and this book is

I want to see this movie.. it looks very good.

when i die if i go to heaven carey mulligan is gon b my angel.

this movie always reminded me of gatsby from vlogaftercollege :P

I would enjoy the book more if I don't have to do any assignments

What's the name of the song that plays the rest of the way through the trailer?

The best movie ever created, favourite film

0:30 Amitabh Bachan

i wish i could kill Daisy 
God! 
just finished watching the whole movie and internally cringing ??

Leo was amazing

Reading the book now for school and I would love it if I wasn't tired all the time. It's a great book. Not going to watch the movie till done.

This movie looks epic!

Read the book because I wanted to, and I loved it!

The worst film Leo stared in

I hate that they had modern music in it, should've played the music of that time period. Daisy was the typical spoiled self serving social climbing bitch.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR LIFE <3

Watch the thrown bitches

I thought Achochol was banned in 1922? And I thought on the black market it was more expensive.

I just finished the book. Now i REALLY wanna see the movie!!

This film is worth watching, but if you just saw the trailer it could be the best film ever made!!

I haven't seen this movie but it's extremely long and on tv I saw it had 2 and a half stars.. ? is it worth watching? Haha ?

"i drive"

no church in the wild is the most fitting song for this movie

started to read it when I was twelve, needed a dictionary to get passed the first page. perhaps I'll return to it when my vocabulary is a little more developed.

Everything was good from the movie except the songs played, common!  a rap song for a 30s movies

the film was ok not great but Leos performance is brilliant and the soundtrack is also the best thing about the film

Não gosto nada do que está a aqui.

That was the most captivating film I've ever seen! This trailer doesn't do justice!

Great job by Baz Luhrmann.

music of the trailer in minut 0

I am about to read this book for my English class. I have never seen the movie nor read this before. Does anyone recommend just reading the book and watch the movie after I'm done or should I watch the movie beforehand and then read the book?

What's the name of the song

Can someone identify each song in this trailer?

at the end Gatsby dies

For those who haven't read the book or watched the movie. Gatsby gets shot and killed at the end lel

I was "forced" to read this too but I loved it. It was an excellent read & I did find this version of the movie well done.

if someone  asks me about love and confidence or simply why i don't trust people , i'll tell him " watch THE GREAT GATSBY" and you'll understand .

4 years later I'm still like: Daisy, bitch.

Loved this book when I was lil'!

For some reason this movie had a big impact on me and rarely movies make me emotional at all

the bitch didn't even blink coldblodded after all his done for her....

Gatspy is alegend of NewYork?

"so we beat on, boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past" what a damn movie!!!!

Truly this movie is amazing, it really shows you how can love make miracles!!

Mm voice of West Egg

Where can I watch this?

I love the 'blow out the candle' song

how the fuck did i missed this Leo movie

What's the song at the start

the best and my favorite movie

my english teacher forced me to read this fucking book so can someone please give me a brief summary because this trailer makes no sense

??

leo deserved an oscar for this movie

I feel that Paul Newman would have been a great Gatsby

I read this just for fun.

50 shades of grey for the even bigger hipster ;)

SPIDERMAN DID GREAT THIS MOVIE

die baz

This trailer DOES capture the mood of Fitzgerald's book better than the 1974 (?) film version.

Gatsby ,,,, the great Gatsby

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

whats the bladdy songs??? the one at the start, someone please tell me

*in 1938 daisy dies,actually she gets burned to death* Ohk now  umm feeling a lot better

If my grandmother's still alive, she'd be cursing Daisy to death. Yeah, that's how my grandma reacts to every villain that she sees if she's still alive.

Ending is so fucked up

If i cry on this movie, and also on every movie by leonardo dicrapio when is die, I think the problem is at me, I am gay ? :)))

Wait did daisy find out at the end tht he got shot? Like did she not love him if she knew?

By the time she was a 40 or 50 year old woman, Daisy would definitely have deeply regretted not going with her heart and going with Gatsby. Then again, she's not the type of woman that deserves love anyways.

The story of Gatsby is basically mine... I just don't know how to get rich haha

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete. And though the movie adaptations of books are almost never as good as the book itself, this movie is phenomenal. It is not only beautifully made, but it's accurate, following the book by its words. Bravo to the author of the book and the writers of the movie.

The fim that made Leo absolutly hate Baz Luhrmann.

I didn't like how they put the rap in the sound track.  I liked the movie, but I certainly didn't love it.

Now, Robert Redford was a handsome Gatsby though!

This movie was so similar to Romeo n Juliet it made me cry T.T

What's the intro song called? The one at the beginning before the thunderstorm scene.

aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece

Starting this for A level ??

Whats the song in first part of the trailer?

Game for when you watch the movie: take a shot every time gatsby says "old sport"

poor Gatsy...doing all these things for someone that is not worth pursuing...

Sophomores? Anyone?

I just don't understand these kind of movie

Love or hate him, you gotta admit. Baz Lurhmann sure has an eye for beauty

Still confused what its about...

Thumbs up if your reading this for english

I really could feel how intense Daisy's love for Gatsby was. The actress did her character much justice. It's a shame though, that Daisy Buchanan couldn't overcome her self loathing relationship, and her materialistic view on the world.

Is this movie any good?

wasn't the soundtrack supposed to be "will u still love me" by lena del ray?

What was the song at the very beginning

Parker?

My favorite movie! Excellent cast! Well done. Bravo! Superb soundtrack. I can't get enough.

plz I want the full movie

I really hate Daisy more than Tom.

best movie in the world

I have to read the book for school. I hope it's good

HE WAITED FOR THIS BITCH AND SHE DIDNT EVEN CALL FUCK ME UP THIS FILM MAN

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!

This movie has the worst soundtrack

I watched it in my history class

daisy bitch -_- . I've never been so angry at a character like this before

Why the sountrack rap?....This was jazz...roaring 20's. I turned it off....couldn't watch it.

Absolutely love the film, but the book really is great - Fitzgerald novel is to subtle to be captured fully in a film

if the one who rich as hell like gasby cannot even get his woman, so how the hell on earth a poor guy like me can ?  :c

Best film I've ever watched

this book inspired me as a young man.

I love this movie

Baz Luhrmann had a horrible vision for this film and it turned out to be a disappointment.

I 
Really
Don't 
Get 
It

the song name plz 1:10 to 1:54

anyone here from the harry styles Edit????

the book is so amazing

nice movie

They could do a modern version set in 2019.

Such an underrated movie

The most boring movie I have ever seen

Elon Musk... anyone?

The movie was really great. And Leo did a awesome god portraying Gatsby. Recommend you watch it, bet you'll like it

We also need Tender is the night!

nice movie !

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

Can we just look at this then look at the new ghostbuster trailer. This is nothing short of a majestic work of art.

5

SOON FUCKING HAWT ?

One of the few times that the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. Seriously watch it, it's amazing!!!

Daisy is such a lame character.Almost cried at the end.Masterpiece.

such a captivating movie . with an elegance of it's own . I sure hope to experience another film like "the great Gatsby" again . because I was drown to this world of wonderful charms and different kinds of people who live to  be surfaced again to realty of the touching End

We never read this in any of my English classes, I read it because I wanted to and I absolutely loved it!

I love this Trailer <3

whats the song

Honestly, this was a good anime but I prefer the manga way more.

which is the name of the second song?

Lol I was made to read this for my English lit class, but I enjoyed it, why is everyone complaining?

Such a boring book made into something majestic. Honestly favourite movie

Shes such A BITCH. u know who i am talking about.

the best movie i ever watched
every time left with tears in the eye
Can somebody answer WHY PEOPLE ARE SO MEAN...

the ending makes me so angry every time I watch or think about it. The least daisy could have done or anyone in fact other than nick go to gatsby's funeral and I can't believe she let him take the fall for what she did and she went crawling back to her cheating husband I wish they would've died instead

I hate the ending to this story. I wish Tom and Daisy got what they deserved. I wish Nick wouldn't had let Jay's reputation go down the drain. I cried so much at the end..

0:17 what is that song?

It seems like the Roaring 20s, right after ww1 which devastated Europe, was when the US first became the world's most powerful nation

diasy=cheap whore

hi

I'm making a trailer for my presentation in class because we read the novel and it's hard coming up with ideas with just pictures I need help?

whats the song at the beginning

Só essa música que nada a ver ne pessoal

Amazing movie!

I need to know the name of the first song! Does anyone knows? PLEASE! Gess it's Kanye?

finished the book in school and starting watching the movie today and I just finished the whole movie and loved it!!!
Love Leonardo DiCaprio

Gatsby dies.

And this is why you don't EVER see women doing this love traingle stuff. No woman will EVER do this for a man, well, i retract my comment, it all depends on his wallet.

Everything for love...

This is such a amazing movie! ???

??? ???????????? ????? ???? ????

I watched it bcz of Big B the legend

We are reading this in class right now and there's a ton of people complaining how it's too difficult to read and that it's boring. I don't understand why they think that?? This is one of the most beautiful book to be ever written in my opinion and there is so much meaning behind it. I mean the book is only 8 or 9 chapters so it's not that hard. it's disappointing

Forced to read the book in English. much better then this shit movie tho.

I hate this book :)

This is basically the orgin story of Spider Man. lol

I love the1920s and this book is

I want to see this movie.. it looks very good.

when i die if i go to heaven carey mulligan is gon b my angel.

this movie always reminded me of gatsby from vlogaftercollege :P

I would enjoy the book more if I don't have to do any assignments

What's the name of the song that plays the rest of the way through the trailer?

The best movie ever created, favourite film

0:30 Amitabh Bachan

i wish i could kill Daisy 
God! 
just finished watching the whole movie and internally cringing ??

Leo was amazing

Reading the book now for school and I would love it if I wasn't tired all the time. It's a great book. Not going to watch the movie till done.

This movie looks epic!

Read the book because I wanted to, and I loved it!

The worst film Leo stared in

I hate that they had modern music in it, should've played the music of that time period. Daisy was the typical spoiled self serving social climbing bitch.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR LIFE <3

Watch the thrown bitches

I thought Achochol was banned in 1922? And I thought on the black market it was more expensive.

I just finished the book. Now i REALLY wanna see the movie!!

This film is worth watching, but if you just saw the trailer it could be the best film ever made!!

I haven't seen this movie but it's extremely long and on tv I saw it had 2 and a half stars.. ? is it worth watching? Haha ?

"i drive"

no church in the wild is the most fitting song for this movie

started to read it when I was twelve, needed a dictionary to get passed the first page. perhaps I'll return to it when my vocabulary is a little more developed.

Everything was good from the movie except the songs played, common!  a rap song for a 30s movies

the film was ok not great but Leos performance is brilliant and the soundtrack is also the best thing about the film

Não gosto nada do que está a aqui.

That was the most captivating film I've ever seen! This trailer doesn't do justice!

Great job by Baz Luhrmann.

music of the trailer in minut 0

I am about to read this book for my English class. I have never seen the movie nor read this before. Does anyone recommend just reading the book and watch the movie after I'm done or should I watch the movie beforehand and then read the book?

What's the name of the song

Can someone identify each song in this trailer?

at the end Gatsby dies

For those who haven't read the book or watched the movie. Gatsby gets shot and killed at the end lel

I was "forced" to read this too but I loved it. It was an excellent read & I did find this version of the movie well done.

if someone  asks me about love and confidence or simply why i don't trust people , i'll tell him " watch THE GREAT GATSBY" and you'll understand .

4 years later I'm still like: Daisy, bitch.

Loved this book when I was lil'!

For some reason this movie had a big impact on me and rarely movies make me emotional at all

the bitch didn't even blink coldblodded after all his done for her....

Gatspy is alegend of NewYork?

"so we beat on, boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past" what a damn movie!!!!

Truly this movie is amazing, it really shows you how can love make miracles!!

Mm voice of West Egg

Where can I watch this?

I love the 'blow out the candle' song

how the fuck did i missed this Leo movie

What's the song at the start

the best and my favorite movie

my english teacher forced me to read this fucking book so can someone please give me a brief summary because this trailer makes no sense

??

leo deserved an oscar for this movie

I feel that Paul Newman would have been a great Gatsby

I read this just for fun.

50 shades of grey for the even bigger hipster ;)

SPIDERMAN DID GREAT THIS MOVIE

die baz

This trailer DOES capture the mood of Fitzgerald's book better than the 1974 (?) film version.

Gatsby ,,,, the great Gatsby

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

In the end, the woman with red hair shouted TOM TOM, why didn't anyone hear it? The horn wasn't that loud!

This trailer gives the movie a whole different tone.

Spider-Man+Jack+Shahensha=???

I cannot unhear Spider-Man when I watch this movie.

Easily one of the best movies

I go to school in London so we don't get to read The Great Gatsby. In retrospect, I'm actually happy they make us read Shakespeare and classic novels like this because when would we ordinarily get the chance to read them. Maybe i'll try reading The Great Gatsby sometime.

I love this trailer soooo much ?

this movie is so fuckin sad and Daisy is an asshole.

can someone tell me the song?

dat bitch ....

The Great Gatspy By : Sir. Scott Fitzgerald! 
? I'm reading the book!

Daisy sadly is the definition of a gold digger.

They blew it. Di Caprio was born to play this role, and he played it perfectly. But they miscalculated on just about every other aspect of this movie. The book and the whole story, is about the times, and it should be properly set, and rooted in the times, i.e. no modern dance music. And the sets were cartoony at best, and unrealistically grandiose at worst. No - it' just didn't work, but that was no fault of Di Caprio's.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

Tobey my baby

Fantastic book! Really shows how the "idea" of having something, is better than the actual thing, and how in the 20's people would do anything for wealth. Daisy gave up true love for wealth, and she did so very knowingly.....just a fantastically profound book.??

What is this movie about? Lol

Perfect casting

This trailer is so beautiful.

Some of the ugliest bitches are in this movie

Spider-Man

so what's the meaning of it's all make. sense?

Warning: DO NOT read the comments. It is FILLED with spoilers.

nice movie,  and 1:39 reminded me mafia 1 XD

what song is that in the very beginning???

The Great Gatsby is one of those novels you might of read and regret doing so being indifferent to what happens to the character by the time you put it down.

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete.

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

Tobey my baby

Fantastic book! Really shows how the "idea" of having something, is better than the actual thing, and how in the 20's people would do anything for wealth. Daisy gave up true love for wealth, and she did so very knowingly.....just a fantastically profound book.??

What is this movie about? Lol

Perfect casting

This trailer is so beautiful.

Some of the ugliest bitches are in this movie

Spider-Man

so what's the meaning of it's all make. sense?

Warning: DO NOT read the comments. It is FILLED with spoilers.

nice movie,  and 1:39 reminded me mafia 1 XD

what song is that in the very beginning???

The Great Gatsby is one of those novels you might of read and regret doing so being indifferent to what happens to the character by the time you put it down.

one of the greatest movies of our generation

*in 1938 daisy dies,actually she gets burned to death* Ohk now  umm feeling a lot better

If my grandmother's still alive, she'd be cursing Daisy to death. Yeah, that's how my grandma reacts to every villain that she sees if she's still alive.

Ending is so fucked up

If i cry on this movie, and also on every movie by leonardo dicrapio when is die, I think the problem is at me, I am gay ? :)))

Wait did daisy find out at the end tht he got shot? Like did she not love him if she knew?

By the time she was a 40 or 50 year old woman, Daisy would definitely have deeply regretted not going with her heart and going with Gatsby. Then again, she's not the type of woman that deserves love anyways.

The story of Gatsby is basically mine... I just don't know how to get rich haha

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete. And though the movie adaptations of books are almost never as good as the book itself, this movie is phenomenal. It is not only beautifully made, but it's accurate, following the book by its words. Bravo to the author of the book and the writers of the movie.

The fim that made Leo absolutly hate Baz Luhrmann.

I didn't like how they put the rap in the sound track.  I liked the movie, but I certainly didn't love it.

Now, Robert Redford was a handsome Gatsby though!

This movie was so similar to Romeo n Juliet it made me cry T.T

What's the intro song called? The one at the beginning before the thunderstorm scene.

aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece

Starting this for A level ??

Whats the song in first part of the trailer?

Game for when you watch the movie: take a shot every time gatsby says "old sport"

poor Gatsy...doing all these things for someone that is not worth pursuing...

Sophomores? Anyone?

I just don't understand these kind of movie

Love or hate him, you gotta admit. Baz Lurhmann sure has an eye for beauty

Still confused what its about...

Thumbs up if your reading this for english

I really could feel how intense Daisy's love for Gatsby was. The actress did her character much justice. It's a shame though, that Daisy Buchanan couldn't overcome her self loathing relationship, and her materialistic view on the world.

Is this movie any good?

wasn't the soundtrack supposed to be "will u still love me" by lena del ray?

What was the song at the very beginning

Parker?

My favorite movie! Excellent cast! Well done. Bravo! Superb soundtrack. I can't get enough.

plz I want the full movie

I really hate Daisy more than Tom.

best movie in the world

I have to read the book for school. I hope it's good

HE WAITED FOR THIS BITCH AND SHE DIDNT EVEN CALL FUCK ME UP THIS FILM MAN

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!

This movie has the worst soundtrack

I watched it in my history class

daisy bitch -_- . I've never been so angry at a character like this before

Why the sountrack rap?....This was jazz...roaring 20's. I turned it off....couldn't watch it.

Absolutely love the film, but the book really is great - Fitzgerald novel is to subtle to be captured fully in a film

if the one who rich as hell like gasby cannot even get his woman, so how the hell on earth a poor guy like me can ?  :c

Best film I've ever watched

this book inspired me as a young man.

I love this movie

Baz Luhrmann had a horrible vision for this film and it turned out to be a disappointment.

I 
Really
Don't 
Get 
It

the song name plz 1:10 to 1:54

anyone here from the harry styles Edit????

the book is so amazing

nice movie

They could do a modern version set in 2019.

Such an underrated movie

The most boring movie I have ever seen

Elon Musk... anyone?

The movie was really great. And Leo did a awesome god portraying Gatsby. Recommend you watch it, bet you'll like it

We also need Tender is the night!

nice movie !

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

Can we just look at this then look at the new ghostbuster trailer. This is nothing short of a majestic work of art.

5

SOON FUCKING HAWT ?

One of the few times that the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. Seriously watch it, it's amazing!!!

Daisy is such a lame character.Almost cried at the end.Masterpiece.

such a captivating movie . with an elegance of it's own . I sure hope to experience another film like "the great Gatsby" again . because I was drown to this world of wonderful charms and different kinds of people who live to  be surfaced again to realty of the touching End

We never read this in any of my English classes, I read it because I wanted to and I absolutely loved it!

I love this Trailer <3

whats the song

Honestly, this was a good anime but I prefer the manga way more.

which is the name of the second song?

Lol I was made to read this for my English lit class, but I enjoyed it, why is everyone complaining?

Such a boring book made into something majestic. Honestly favourite movie

Shes such A BITCH. u know who i am talking about.

the best movie i ever watched
every time left with tears in the eye
Can somebody answer WHY PEOPLE ARE SO MEAN...

the ending makes me so angry every time I watch or think about it. The least daisy could have done or anyone in fact other than nick go to gatsby's funeral and I can't believe she let him take the fall for what she did and she went crawling back to her cheating husband I wish they would've died instead

I hate the ending to this story. I wish Tom and Daisy got what they deserved. I wish Nick wouldn't had let Jay's reputation go down the drain. I cried so much at the end..

0:17 what is that song?

It seems like the Roaring 20s, right after ww1 which devastated Europe, was when the US first became the world's most powerful nation

diasy=cheap whore

hi

I'm making a trailer for my presentation in class because we read the novel and it's hard coming up with ideas with just pictures I need help?

whats the song at the beginning

Só essa música que nada a ver ne pessoal

Amazing movie!

I need to know the name of the first song! Does anyone knows? PLEASE! Gess it's Kanye?

finished the book in school and starting watching the movie today and I just finished the whole movie and loved it!!!
Love Leonardo DiCaprio

Gatsby dies.

And this is why you don't EVER see women doing this love traingle stuff. No woman will EVER do this for a man, well, i retract my comment, it all depends on his wallet.

Everything for love...

This is such a amazing movie! ???

??? ???????????? ????? ???? ????

I watched it bcz of Big B the legend

We are reading this in class right now and there's a ton of people complaining how it's too difficult to read and that it's boring. I don't understand why they think that?? This is one of the most beautiful book to be ever written in my opinion and there is so much meaning behind it. I mean the book is only 8 or 9 chapters so it's not that hard. it's disappointing

Forced to read the book in English. much better then this shit movie tho.

I hate this book :)

This is basically the orgin story of Spider Man. lol

I love the1920s and this book is

I want to see this movie.. it looks very good.

when i die if i go to heaven carey mulligan is gon b my angel.

this movie always reminded me of gatsby from vlogaftercollege :P

I would enjoy the book more if I don't have to do any assignments

What's the name of the song that plays the rest of the way through the trailer?

The best movie ever created, favourite film

0:30 Amitabh Bachan

i wish i could kill Daisy 
God! 
just finished watching the whole movie and internally cringing ??

Leo was amazing

Reading the book now for school and I would love it if I wasn't tired all the time. It's a great book. Not going to watch the movie till done.

This movie looks epic!

Read the book because I wanted to, and I loved it!

The worst film Leo stared in

I hate that they had modern music in it, should've played the music of that time period. Daisy was the typical spoiled self serving social climbing bitch.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR LIFE <3

Watch the thrown bitches

I thought Achochol was banned in 1922? And I thought on the black market it was more expensive.

I just finished the book. Now i REALLY wanna see the movie!!

This film is worth watching, but if you just saw the trailer it could be the best film ever made!!

I haven't seen this movie but it's extremely long and on tv I saw it had 2 and a half stars.. ? is it worth watching? Haha ?

"i drive"

no church in the wild is the most fitting song for this movie

started to read it when I was twelve, needed a dictionary to get passed the first page. perhaps I'll return to it when my vocabulary is a little more developed.

Everything was good from the movie except the songs played, common!  a rap song for a 30s movies

the film was ok not great but Leos performance is brilliant and the soundtrack is also the best thing about the film

Não gosto nada do que está a aqui.

That was the most captivating film I've ever seen! This trailer doesn't do justice!

Great job by Baz Luhrmann.

music of the trailer in minut 0

I am about to read this book for my English class. I have never seen the movie nor read this before. Does anyone recommend just reading the book and watch the movie after I'm done or should I watch the movie beforehand and then read the book?

What's the name of the song

Can someone identify each song in this trailer?

at the end Gatsby dies

For those who haven't read the book or watched the movie. Gatsby gets shot and killed at the end lel

I was "forced" to read this too but I loved it. It was an excellent read & I did find this version of the movie well done.

if someone  asks me about love and confidence or simply why i don't trust people , i'll tell him " watch THE GREAT GATSBY" and you'll understand .

4 years later I'm still like: Daisy, bitch.

Loved this book when I was lil'!

For some reason this movie had a big impact on me and rarely movies make me emotional at all

the bitch didn't even blink coldblodded after all his done for her....

Gatspy is alegend of NewYork?

"so we beat on, boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past" what a damn movie!!!!

Truly this movie is amazing, it really shows you how can love make miracles!!

Mm voice of West Egg

Where can I watch this?

I love the 'blow out the candle' song

how the fuck did i missed this Leo movie

What's the song at the start

the best and my favorite movie

my english teacher forced me to read this fucking book so can someone please give me a brief summary because this trailer makes no sense

??

leo deserved an oscar for this movie

I feel that Paul Newman would have been a great Gatsby

I read this just for fun.

50 shades of grey for the even bigger hipster ;)

SPIDERMAN DID GREAT THIS MOVIE

die baz

This trailer DOES capture the mood of Fitzgerald's book better than the 1974 (?) film version.

Gatsby ,,,, the great Gatsby

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

I don't care what anyone says, this film is still amazing

i loved the book and thought this movie was great. i don't know why it got so many poor reviews.

Piece of shit movie, the book was better. Leo was shit too.

In the end, the woman with red hair shouted TOM TOM, why didn't anyone hear it? The horn wasn't that loud!

This trailer gives the movie a whole different tone.

Spider-Man+Jack+Shahensha=???

I cannot unhear Spider-Man when I watch this movie.

Easily one of the best movies

I go to school in London so we don't get to read The Great Gatsby. In retrospect, I'm actually happy they make us read Shakespeare and classic novels like this because when would we ordinarily get the chance to read them. Maybe i'll try reading The Great Gatsby sometime.

I love this trailer soooo much ?

this movie is so fuckin sad and Daisy is an asshole.

can someone tell me the song?

dat bitch ....

The Great Gatspy By : Sir. Scott Fitzgerald! 
? I'm reading the book!

Daisy sadly is the definition of a gold digger.

They blew it. Di Caprio was born to play this role, and he played it perfectly. But they miscalculated on just about every other aspect of this movie. The book and the whole story, is about the times, and it should be properly set, and rooted in the times, i.e. no modern dance music. And the sets were cartoony at best, and unrealistically grandiose at worst. No - it' just didn't work, but that was no fault of Di Caprio's.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

Tobey my baby

Fantastic book! Really shows how the "idea" of having something, is better than the actual thing, and how in the 20's people would do anything for wealth. Daisy gave up true love for wealth, and she did so very knowingly.....just a fantastically profound book.??

What is this movie about? Lol

Perfect casting

This trailer is so beautiful.

Some of the ugliest bitches are in this movie

Spider-Man

so what's the meaning of it's all make. sense?

Warning: DO NOT read the comments. It is FILLED with spoilers.

nice movie,  and 1:39 reminded me mafia 1 XD

what song is that in the very beginning???

The Great Gatsby is one of those novels you might of read and regret doing so being indifferent to what happens to the character by the time you put it down.

one of the greatest movies of our generation

*in 1938 daisy dies,actually she gets burned to death* Ohk now  umm feeling a lot better

If my grandmother's still alive, she'd be cursing Daisy to death. Yeah, that's how my grandma reacts to every villain that she sees if she's still alive.

Ending is so fucked up

If i cry on this movie, and also on every movie by leonardo dicrapio when is die, I think the problem is at me, I am gay ? :)))

Wait did daisy find out at the end tht he got shot? Like did she not love him if she knew?

By the time she was a 40 or 50 year old woman, Daisy would definitely have deeply regretted not going with her heart and going with Gatsby. Then again, she's not the type of woman that deserves love anyways.

The story of Gatsby is basically mine... I just don't know how to get rich haha

You gotta read the book. Takes a couple chapters to get into but once you're there you won't be able to put it down. Such a good story

It is about how everything is a game or a play for American or European rich and this includes others people lives. It's not that a poor man falls in love with a rich girl and they run away and happily live after. Don't be like them because it seems many people in some ways want to. The master race ?? And when carraway goes to party for the first time there is a voice saying in behind. There is no need to believe in God !!! It is like a passing chatter. 
This sick people. Be everything they are not. Be humble truthful modest smart and intelligent with a heart and mind to think and you will find truth. Be like them this is what you will become Daisy or her husband and the women that golf player one or the one who had affair or the one who killed gatsby and if you run after them you will end up like gatsby, not the great gatsby but the poor gatsby. And if you waste your life reading about them and looking into their lifes, you will end up like nick carraway, disgusted angry pitiful disappointed.

I hate sad end movies ?

3D what?    LOL

3D what? LOL

ok ... uhh it's daisy and I think they could have found someone better

why does Leo always end up dying in a movie? ??

Never read the book, never watched the movie.

This book was a doorway to a devout man's romantic fantasies. Gatsby was a man of good heart and mind, giving up his life for the sake of his love. Daisy was a character that was full of loving playfulness, and though she drove me half to insanity, I feel that the book would have been nothing without her. All of the characters, in fact, seemed to fit together to make this masterpiece of a book, and I believe that the story needs every character is contains to be complete. And though the movie adaptations of books are almost never as good as the book itself, this movie is phenomenal. It is not only beautifully made, but it's accurate, following the book by its words. Bravo to the author of the book and the writers of the movie.

The fim that made Leo absolutly hate Baz Luhrmann.

I didn't like how they put the rap in the sound track.  I liked the movie, but I certainly didn't love it.

Now, Robert Redford was a handsome Gatsby though!

This movie was so similar to Romeo n Juliet it made me cry T.T

What's the intro song called? The one at the beginning before the thunderstorm scene.

aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece

Starting this for A level ??

Whats the song in first part of the trailer?

Game for when you watch the movie: take a shot every time gatsby says "old sport"

poor Gatsy...doing all these things for someone that is not worth pursuing...

Sophomores? Anyone?

I just don't understand these kind of movie

Love or hate him, you gotta admit. Baz Lurhmann sure has an eye for beauty

Still confused what its about...

Thumbs up if your reading this for english

I really could feel how intense Daisy's love for Gatsby was. The actress did her character much justice. It's a shame though, that Daisy Buchanan couldn't overcome her self loathing relationship, and her materialistic view on the world.

Is this movie any good?

wasn't the soundtrack supposed to be "will u still love me" by lena del ray?

What was the song at the very beginning

Parker?

My favorite movie! Excellent cast! Well done. Bravo! Superb soundtrack. I can't get enough.

plz I want the full movie

I really hate Daisy more than Tom.

best movie in the world

I have to read the book for school. I hope it's good

HE WAITED FOR THIS BITCH AND SHE DIDNT EVEN CALL FUCK ME UP THIS FILM MAN

Why can't he ever have a happy ending?

This movie just didn't do it for me at all. The story is just not interesting to me. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. Students should be encouraged to read what they want not forced to read the same damn book as a class. I have never liked any book that I was forced to read. It's like they make you over think it instead of enjoy it. It was written for entertainment not to be tested about and quizzed about over and over again.

One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!

This movie has the worst soundtrack

I watched it in my history class

daisy bitch -_- . I've never been so angry at a character like this before

Why the sountrack rap?....This was jazz...roaring 20's. I turned it off....couldn't watch it.

Absolutely love the film, but the book really is great - Fitzgerald novel is to subtle to be captured fully in a film

if the one who rich as hell like gasby cannot even get his woman, so how the hell on earth a poor guy like me can ?  :c

Best film I've ever watched

this book inspired me as a young man.

I love this movie

Baz Luhrmann had a horrible vision for this film and it turned out to be a disappointment.

I 
Really
Don't 
Get 
It

the song name plz 1:10 to 1:54

anyone here from the harry styles Edit????

the book is so amazing

nice movie

They could do a modern version set in 2019.

Such an underrated movie

The most boring movie I have ever seen

Elon Musk... anyone?

The movie was really great. And Leo did a awesome god portraying Gatsby. Recommend you watch it, bet you'll like it

We also need Tender is the night!

nice movie !

Everybody probably got lung cancer after this movie

the best trailer ever

I don't care what anyone says, this film is still amazing

i loved the book and thought this movie was great. i don't know why it got so many poor reviews.

Piece of shit movie, the book was better. Leo was shit too.

In the end, the woman with red hair shouted TOM TOM, why didn't anyone hear it? The horn wasn't that loud!

This trailer gives the movie a whole different tone.

Spider-Man+Jack+Shahensha=???

I cannot unhear Spider-Man when I watch this movie.

Easily one of the best movies

I go to school in London so we don't get to read The Great Gatsby. In retrospect, I'm actually happy they make us read Shakespeare and classic novels like this because when would we ordinarily get the chance to read them. Maybe i'll try reading The Great Gatsby sometime.

I love this trailer soooo much ?

this movie is so fuckin sad and Daisy is an asshole.

can someone tell me the song?

dat bitch ....

The Great Gatspy By : Sir. Scott Fitzgerald! 
? I'm reading the book!

Daisy sadly is the definition of a gold digger.

They blew it. Di Caprio was born to play this role, and he played it perfectly. But they miscalculated on just about every other aspect of this movie. The book and the whole story, is about the times, and it should be properly set, and rooted in the times, i.e. no modern dance music. And the sets were cartoony at best, and unrealistically grandiose at worst. No - it' just didn't work, but that was no fault of Di Caprio's.

I have this for my exam that's the only reason that I need to watch this, instead of reading it. last level of laziness

i swear to god, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life

SOON FUCKING HAWT ?

One of the few times that the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. Seriously watch it, it's amazing!!!

Daisy is such a lame character.Almost cried at the end.Masterpiece.

such a captivating movie . with an elegance of it's own . I sure hope to experience another film like "the great Gatsby" again . because I was drown to this world of wonderful charms and different kinds of people who live to  be surfaced again to realty of the touching End

We never read this in any of my English classes, I read it because I wanted to and I absolutely loved it!

I love this Trailer <3

whats the song

Honestly, this was a good anime but I prefer the manga way more.

which is the name of the second song?

Lol I was made to read this for my English lit class, but I enjoyed it, why is everyone complaining?

Such a boring book made into something majestic. Honestly favourite movie

Shes such A BITCH. u know who i am talking about.

the best movie i ever watched
every time left with tears in the eye
Can somebody answer WHY PEOPLE ARE SO MEAN...

the ending makes me so angry every time I watch or think about it. The least daisy could have done or anyone in fact other than nick go to gatsby's funeral and I can't believe she let him take the fall for what she did and she went crawling back to her cheating husband I wish they would've died instead

I hate the ending to this story. I wish Tom and Daisy got what they deserved. I wish Nick wouldn't had let Jay's reputation go down the drain. I cried so much at the end..

0:17 what is that song?

It seems like the Roaring 20s, right after ww1 which devastated Europe, was when the US first became the world's most powerful nation

diasy=cheap whore

hi

I'm making a trailer for my presentation in class because we read the novel and it's hard coming up with ideas with just pictures I need help?

whats the song at the beginning

Só essa música que nada a ver ne pessoal

Amazing movie!

I need to know the name of the first song! Does anyone knows? PLEASE! Gess it's Kanye?

finished the book in school and starting watching the movie today and I just finished the whole movie and loved it!!!
Love Leonardo DiCaprio

Gatsby dies.

And this is why you don't EVER see women doing this love traingle stuff. No woman will EVER do this for a man, well, i retract my comment, it all depends on his wallet.

Everything for love...

This is such a amazing movie! ???

??? ???????????? ????? ???? ????

I watched it bcz of Big B the legend

We are reading this in class right now and there's a ton of people complaining how it's too difficult to read and that it's boring. I don't understand why they think that?? This is one of the most beautiful book to be ever written in my opinion and there is so much meaning behind it. I mean the book is only 8 or 9 chapters so it's not that hard. it's disappointing

Forced to read the book in English. much better then this shit movie tho.

I hate this book :)

This is basically the orgin story of Spider Man. lol

I love the1920s and this book is

I want to see this movie.. it looks very good.

when i die if i go to heaven carey mulligan is gon b my angel.

this movie always reminded me of gatsby from vlogaftercollege :P

I would enjoy the book more if I don't have to do any assignments

What's the name of the song that plays the rest of the way through the trailer?

The best movie ever created, favourite film

0:30 Amitabh Bachan

i wish i could kill Daisy 
God! 
just finished watching the whole movie and internally cringing ??

Leo was amazing

Reading the book now for school and I would love it if I wasn't tired all the time. It's a great book. Not going to watch the movie till done.

This movie looks epic!

Read the book because I wanted to, and I loved it!

The worst film Leo stared in

I hate that they had modern music in it, should've played the music of that time period. Daisy was the typical spoiled self serving social climbing bitch.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR LIFE <3

Watch the thrown bitches

I thought Achochol was banned in 1922? And I thought on the black market it was more expensive.

I just finished the book. Now i REALLY wanna see the movie!!

This film is worth watching, but if you just saw the trailer it could be the best film ever made!!

I haven't seen this movie but it's extremely long and on tv I saw it had 2 and a half stars.. ? is it worth watching? Haha ?

"i drive"

no church in the wild is the most fitting song for this movie

started to read it when I was twelve, needed a dictionary to get passed the first page. perhaps I'll return to it when my vocabulary is a little more developed.

Everything was good from the movie except the songs played, common!  a rap song for a 30s movies

the film was ok not great but Leos performance is brilliant and the soundtrack is also the best thing about the film

Não gosto nada do que está a aqui.

That was the most captivating film I've ever seen! This trailer doesn't do justice!

Great job by Baz Luhrmann.

music of the trailer in minut 0

I am about to read this book for my English class. I have never seen the movie nor read this before. Does anyone recommend just reading the book and watch the movie after I'm done or should I watch the movie beforehand and then read the book?

What's the name of the song

Can someone identify each song in this trailer?

at the end Gatsby dies

For those who haven't read the book or watched the movie. Gatsby gets shot and killed at the end lel

I was "forced" to read this too but I loved it. It was an excellent read & I did find this version of the movie well done.

if someone  asks me about love and confidence or simply why i don't trust people , i'll tell him " watch THE GREAT GATSBY" and you'll understand .

4 years later I'm still like: Daisy, bitch.

Loved this book when I was lil'!

For some reason this movie had a big impact on me and rarely movies make me emotional at all

the bitch didn't even blink coldblodded after all his done for her....

Gatspy is alegend of NewYork?

"so we beat on, boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past" what a damn movie!!!!

Truly this movie is amazing, it really shows you how can love make miracles!!

Mm voice of West Egg

Where can I watch this?

I love the 'blow out the candle' song

how the fuck did i missed this Leo movie

What's the song at the start

the best and my favorite movie

my english teacher forced me to read this fucking book so can someone please give me a brief summary because this trailer makes no sense

??

leo deserved an oscar for this movie

I feel that Paul Newman would have been a great Gatsby

I read this just for fun.

50 shades of grey for the even bigger hipster ;)

SPIDERMAN DID GREAT THIS MOVIE

die baz

This trailer DOES capture the mood of Fitzgerald's book better than the 1974 (?) film version.

Gatsby ,,,, the great Gatsby

As much as i like Leo, I have to say i did not appreciate this adaptation as much as the first. all the effects and glamour took away from the story

Lol I was made to read this for my English lit class, but I enjoyed it, why is everyone complaining?

Such a boring book made into something majestic. Honestly favourite movie

Shes such A BITCH. u know who i am talking about.

the best movie i ever watched
every time left with tears in the eye
Can somebody answer WHY PEOPLE ARE SO MEAN...

the ending makes me so angry every time I watch or think about it. The least daisy could have done or anyone in fact other than nick go to gatsby's funeral and I can't believe she let him take the fall for what she did and she went crawling back to her cheating husband I wish they would've died instead

I hate the ending to this story. I wish Tom and Daisy got what they deserved. I wish Nick wouldn't had let Jay's reputation go down the drain. I cried so much at the end..

0:17 what is that song?

It seems like the Roaring 20s, right after ww1 which devastated Europe, was when the US first became the world's most powerful nation

diasy=cheap whore

hi

I'm making a trailer for my presentation in class because we read the novel and it's hard coming up with ideas with just pictures I need help?

whats the song at the beginning

Só essa música que nada a ver ne pessoal

Amazing movie!

I need to know the name of the first song! Does anyone knows? PLEASE! Gess it's Kanye?

finished the book in school and starting watching the movie today and I just finished the whole movie and loved it!!!
Love Leonardo DiCaprio

Gatsby dies.

And this is why you don't EVER see women doing this love traingle stuff. No woman will EVER do this for a man, well, i retract my comment, it all depends on his wallet.

Everything for love...

This is such a amazing movie! ???

??? ???????????? ????? ???? ????

I watched it bcz of Big B the legend

We are reading this in class right now and there's a ton of people complaining how it's too difficult to read and that it's boring. I don't understand why they think that?? This is one of the most beautiful book to be ever written in my opinion and there is so much meaning behind it. I mean the book is only 8 or 9 chapters so it's not that hard. it's disappointing

Forced to read the book in English. much better then this shit movie tho.

I hate this book :)

This is basically the orgin story of Spider Man. lol

I love the1920s and this book is

I want to see this movie.. it looks very good.

when i die if i go to heaven carey mulligan is gon b my angel.

this movie always reminded me of gatsby from vlogaftercollege :P

I would enjoy the book more if I don't have to do any assignments

What's the name of the song that plays the rest of the way through the trailer?

The best movie ever created, favourite film

0:30 Amitabh Bachan

i wish i could kill Daisy 
God! 
just finished watching the whole movie and internally cringing ??

Leo was amazing

Reading the book now for school and I would love it if I wasn't tired all the time. It's a great book. Not going to watch the movie till done.

This movie looks epic!

Read the book because I wanted to, and I loved it!

The worst film Leo stared in

I hate that they had modern music in it, should've played the music of that time period. Daisy was the typical spoiled self serving social climbing bitch.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR LIFE <3

Watch the thrown bitches

I thought Achochol was banned in 1922? And I thought on the black market it was more expensive.

I just finished the book. Now i REALLY wanna see the movie!!

This film is worth watching, but if you just saw the trailer it could be the best film ever made!!

I haven't seen this movie but it's extremely long and on tv I saw it had 2 and a half stars.. ? is it worth watching? Haha ?

"i drive"

no church in the wild is the most fitting song for this movie

started to read it when I was twelve, needed a dictionary to get passed the first page. perhaps I'll return to it when my voc
